    "keywords": "Basics of enwis Overview In enwis, the difference between master data and transaction data is critical. Master data is necessary to record relatively constant information, such as customers, services, etc. Where possible, this data should only be entered into the system once and stored as master data. The more information users can enter into the master data, the less they need to enter during their day-to-day operations and the more automated and effectively the data can be handled. Master data is recorded in card format. Transaction data includes all documents required to depict the operating business (offers, contracts, orders, etc.). Master data constitutes the basis for depicting the operating business. For example, only three pieces of information normally need to be entered to set up an order: Customer No. Service No. Requested quantity All other information important to processing this order, such as Customer address Responsible contact person Sales agent involved Income and expense accounts will either be maintained in the master data or automatically determined by enwis (such as the posting matrix). enwis provides two forms for depicting the operating business: the contract and the sales order. The contract is used to document a longer term agreement with a customer or supplier. In contrast, the sales order records a single service rendered. The contract can be viewed as a kind of template for sales orders, because a sales order can be created out of a contract with the \"touch of a button\". For this reason, contracts and sales orders basically have a parallel structure and the main difference between the two is the length of time they remain in the system. Invoices and credit notes can only be created out of a sales order. Therefore, it is vital to create sales orders to be able to account for billable services with a customer or supplier. Note Invoices and credit notes can also be created without a previous sales order, but the resulting financial accounting entries have no reference to the service information. In principle, users should always set up contracts, even if it is assumed that there will only be one business case. After being posted, the sales orders are deleted or archived. In contrast, contracts stay on file permanently to trace the business relations with customers and suppliers. Contracts and sales orders basically consist of a header with any number of lines below it. The lines represent the billable business cases. In turn, these lines are assigned of any number of line entries. The most important entries: Waste Entry net change in waste material and recyclable material Equipment Entry net change in receptacles and containers Transport Entry record of vehicle hours, et al. Personnel Entry record of person hours, et al. The line entries have no effect on the invoice calculations. The information in these entries is recorded for the purposes of stock accounting and statistics. The Equipment Entries are the exception to this, because they form the basis for billing for containers. The separation of the billable order lines and the line entries makes it possible to also separate the invoice quantities from the so-called operating quantities. Commercially relevant information and information required by waste legislation can be recorded and posted in the same sales order. This allows users to record and compare costs and revenues in the same sales order and thereby determine the sales order's contribution margin. One special feature of enwis is the option to depict customer-specific and supplier-specific business cases in one sales order. Any number of business cases with any number of customers and vendors, sites and order addresses can be combined into one sales order. Because of this special feature, enwis allows users to generate line-dependent invoices (combine invoices). Combine invoices break down the recorded sales orders into billable components and group these sales order lines into individual customers and vendors. They receive an invoice summarizing all sales order entries that apply to them, even though these may spread across entirely different sales orders. Customers receive an invoice custom-designed to meet their expectations and summarizing all of the sales order entries that apply to them, though they might be spread across entirely different sales orders. Data Management and Data Flow The central data storage elements in enwis are the documents. enwis distinguishes between the following document types: Sales Quotes Contracts Sales Orders Completed Orders Unposted Invoices Unposted Credit Notes The unposted documents are recorded in the so-called waste management line. The waste management line includes all information relevant to the sales order: Service Waste Material Equipment Service Prices Quantity Tour Vehicle Employee Waste Transfer Note Weighbridge Ticket However, this information might not necessarily be in the waste management line; it might also appear in the line entries: Waste Material Waste Entry Vehicle Transport Entry Employee Personnel Entry Equipment Equipment Entry Each sales order line can be assigned any number of line entries. The information is not necessarily written from the lines into the corresponding entries. The system does not transfer information from the entries into the lines. The line entries are normally posted upon order release. The sales order becomes a completed order. The completed order is still permanently associated with the posted entries. The transition from a line entry into an entry means that this information can no longer be deleted. The waste management lines and their associated entries are not separated until an unposted invoice or credit note is created. The combine invoice process breaks the sales order down into its components and combines these into invoices and credit notes. Lines from entirely different sales orders can be brought together to make up one invoice or credit note and the lines of one order can be distributed to different invoices and credit notes. The sales order lines are linked together with one order job number. The order job number is automatically allotted when the sales order is set up or it can be manually assigned. The order job number allows users to trace the various invoice lines and entries emerging from one sales order. When an invoice or credit note is posted, Business Central creates a default sales invoice and records the information important to the waste management industry in so-called invoice ledger entries. Note This is why enwis works with its own cancelation function. When a value is canceled, enwis does not go back to the posted document but to the archived, unposted document. Unlike the posted sales invoice, the unposted document still contains all of the information. It is strongly recommended that the enwis Waste Management Setup be set so that unposted invoices and credit memos are always archived. To work with enwis, it is necessary to have an understanding of documents, posting routines, and cancelation functions: Contracts document longer term agreements with customers and suppliers Contracts are templates for recurring sales orders Sales orders depict a single procedure All sales quotes, contracts, and sales orders can be created with the touch of a button All billable procedures must be recorded in the form of sales orders Releasing a sales order creates a completed order that can be billed using combine invoicing Sales orders can be archived when released The entry information is normally posted as ledger entries when orders are released (e.g. waste ledger entries that monitor inward and outward stock movements) Order release does not mean items are posted to the G/L Account in financial accounting Completed orders can be seamlessly undone in order to add or correct information, unless that information has already been converted into ledger entries The latter can be undone using the appropriate cancelation function. Combine Invoicing combines completed orders into unposted invoices and credit notes Unposted invoices and credit notes can also be seamlessly deleted in order to correct the underlying completed order or sales order. Unposted invoices should not be posted until they have been reviewed. When invoices are posted, the costs and revenues are posted to the G/L Account in financial accounting There is a setting in Invoice Setup that determines whether completed orders should be removed from the system after being completely invoiced and posted or not"

    "title": "Customer and Vendor Overview | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Customer and Vendor Overview General Information The customer card in enwis is in large part identical to the design and function of the customer card in the default sales and marketing menu in Business Central. Only the differences between enwis and the Business Central default will be explained here. First of all, customers can be entered as contacts in the Marketing and Sales menu of Business Central. An existing contact can be set as a customer in the contact card by going to Actions Create as Customer . The customer template is necessary to do this, however. The information is swapped and updated between the two modules. The two fields, Post Code and City , are linked. The post code and city can be entered manually or selected from the post code list and the city list using the look-up function. When the post code is entered, the system looks for a matching city and if there is only one, automatically copies it to the corresponding field. A special feature in enwis not in Business Central is that the system takes into account that a post code in Germany can refer to several communities. In this case, enwis filters the city list through the post code so that users can manually select the right community. If the city is entered first, the system looks for a matching post code and the procedure is similar. Users can define a credit line for a customer in the Credit Limit (LCY) field. This field is routinely referred to when filling out the ledger, sales quotes, sales orders and invoices. The system checks whether the pre-set credit line has been exceeded and, if so, sends users an error message accordingly. The Vendor No. field refers to the business partner logic in enwis. The two sides of a company are called business partners in enwis and they can be entered into the system as customers or vendors but they are linked by a common business partner number. With the Create Vendor function, users can create a vendor copy of a customer. The customer and its vendor counterpart are simultaneously linked as business partners. The number of the associated vendor is shown on the customer card. Note Not all of the fields on the vendor card are automatically filled by the values of the customer (e.g. price group, payment conditions, etc.) The vendor created using this function should be reviewed and the fields corrected or supplemented. The Blocked for New Orders field is historically relevant, because originally it was the only way in Business Central to completely block the customer. To a large part, it is similar to the \"_Ship \" option in the _Blocked field. Note When a customer has to be blocked for new orders, it is absolutely necessary that users check the Block Contracts w. Cust./Vend. box under the Contract tab in Waste Management Setup. If this box is not checked, users can easily create new orders from existing contracts, even for blocked customers. The Location Code field comes from Business Central and has little function in enwis, because any location saved in the customer is not automatically copied to the document header or document line. This field can be hidden using the configuration options in RTC. The Shipment Method Code field also comes from Business Central, but has no meaning for the other waste management industry processes depicted in enwis. This field can be hidden using the configuration options in RTC. The same is true for the original Combine Invoice field, which has been replaced in enwis by a function of the same name. This field can be hidden using the configuration options in RTC. Multiple sub-customers can be assigned to one customer in the Bill-to Customer No. field. This can be set up in two different ways in enwis. Multiple task sites can be entered for one customer. These task sites can be defined as invoice recipients using the Inv. Sub-Address Code field found by going to Start Invoice Sub-Address Code on the customer card. Multiple (sub) customers will be assigned to one customer in the Bill-to Customer No. field as common invoice recipients. Users can assign an internal sorting or filter criterion to a customer using the Order Type Code field. The order types control batch processing (e.g. combine invoice, cyclic document creation, etc.). For example, the order type \"Container\" could encompass all rental orders in one invoice run. Checking the Not Invoicing box blocks the customer completely from invoicing. Order lines that refer to the customer are set to \"Invoice = No\" and therefore not cleared. This setting is especially practical for so-called \"dummy customers\" to be reproduced through internal transactions or cash transactions. A related function is found in the On Hold field. Up to three characters can be entered here (e.g. the initials of the person in charge). When the On Hold field is initialed, the customer is excluded from combine invoices and no collection letters will be sent. In Business Central, this field is only there to control collection runs. In enwis it works with a somewhat different logic. A line code in the field blocks customer sales orders that have not yet been invoiced from combine invoicing. Customers can be assigned a price group using the Price Group field. enwis only determines the price group using the price group matrix (see corresponding training materials under the topic of Pricing). Strictly speaking, this makes the Price Group field superfluous. It only serves to help users avoid the complex logic behind the price group matrix and assign a price group directly to the customer. The Rental Invoice Grp. Code field is used for equipment rental invoices. Rental invoice groups can be set up by going to enwis Services - Equipment - Rental Invoice - Rental Invoice Groups. The rental invoice group code can be assigned to every customer, vendor, task site, order address, and job. The combination of a equipment group and the rental invoice group in the rental invoice matrix serves to ascertain an invoice method for billing the equipment (normally a container). A discount group can be assigned to each customer using the Discount Group field. In contrast to the price group, it is not possible for the system to automatically issue customers or task sites a discount group. The Payments tab does not contain any special features of enwis; rather, it holds all the standard functions of Business Central (see the corresponding training materials for Business Central for more information). The same applies to the Export tab. The Waste Producer No. field refers to the official producer number that must be applied for according to the Closed Substance Cycle Waste Management Act for each producer site code if it accumulates more than 2 tons of hazardous waste. The producer number can be applied for at the responsible government agency. Customers can be categorized into business relation types using the Business Relation Code field. These business relationship types are relevant for things like multi-reports. Multi-reports are generated from each order line, e.g. sales order confirmations, delivery orders, assignment faxes, etc. A multi-report can be called up directly from the sales order by going to Actions Print Multi-Report. The business relation category can be used, for example, to signal the system to send the assignment to the subcontractor (= vendor) per multi-report by setting the business relation category for this vendor to \"Carrier\". In contrast, the customer receives an sales order confirmation. Users can save an employee in the Responsible Employee field who acts as the primary account representative, e.g. as the project head or in customer accounting. The Duration and Distance fields refer to the distance to the customer and the time needed to get there and can be relevant for preparing sales quotes, route scheduling, etc. It is more practical, however, to save these two fields on the task sites of the customer. The Classification field indicates whether the customer is an internal or a municipal customer. The Internal option is used to indicate that the customers are associated companies and the like. This field can be used to filter the customers for viewing and reports (e.g. totals and balances) according to whether they are internal or external. When the Municipal classification is selected, the enwis Public menu becomes available for this customer. Task sites generated for this customer are automatically entered as so-called waste management objects (= municipal task sites). The Various Customer field typically serves to manage one or more dummy customers. Such a dummy can be used, for example, to clear cash transactions. Checking the Various Customer box prevents the system from otherwise looking to the customer's master data during combine invoicing. The fields under the heading Bal. Account Lines can be used to set which order line entries will be copied over from the original order line when the G/L line is entered. In other words, when there is a transaction with two partners, for example, the sale is recorded in one order line and enwis can use the information in this line to automatically show the purchase in a second order line. The Selection Criteria function can be called up in enwis by going to Navigate/Selection Criteria . Selection queries can be used to easily compile and query complex information in the database. Example: Which ISO-certified transporter is allowed to transport hazardous materials to Italy? Such queries can be pre-defined in enwis or compiled on an ad-hoc basis. The results can be shown and copied over into the current documents or ledger. Click on the Task Sites icon to show the task sites of the current customer. The list has already been filtered to only those task sites associated with this customer. Click on the Invoice Sub-Address field to enter additional customer billing addresses that differ from the actual customer address (e.g. the address of task sites). These alternative addresses should not be mistaken for the addresses saved in the Bill-to Customer No. field under the Invoicing tab. A different customer is defined as the invoice recipient in the Bill-to Customer No. field. The invoice sub-addresses is merely a place to store alternative addresses for invoice dispatch. When these alternative addresses need to be used, the address in the Inv. Sub-Address Code field should be entered into the corresponding contract or order lines. A kind of translation table can be set up using the service description. This translation table defines how individual services should be described for specific customers. The designations in the service catalog are customer-specific and might also be assigned explanatory text. Examples of the use of service descriptions include: Material names can be simplified so that laypersons understand them. The customer's individual vocabulary can be used. Materials can be described in ways that make them seem more or less valuable. The service descriptions and text components are automatically copied into sales quotes, contracts, sales orders, and invoices. It can be helpful to save reference catalogs for the customer and its task sites. The positive catalog contains a list of waste materials (per the ordinance) and services that may be posted to the relevant task sites, order addresses, locations, or weighbridges. In contrast, the negative catalog contains a list of materials that may not be posted to the given task sites, order addresses, locations, or weighbridges. Click on the Container icon to see the containers sent to the customer. Clicking on the Equipment Ledger Entries icon opens a list already filtered to those associated with the customer. It shows all containers, regardless of which of the customer's task sites they are in use at. Invoice creation, as part of combine invoicing, can be managed by going to Navigate Sales Invoice Layout . Combine invoicing invoices all of the completed orders for defined period of time. The invoice layout defines how the customer's numerous order lines will be sorted on an invoice or credit note and made more transparent there through the use of additional information. Special features or needs of the customer can also be taken into account with the invoice layout, e.g. generating one invoice per task site. Invoice pre-texts and post-texts are a convenient way to communicate additional information. They allow users to automatically insert lines of text before and after other elements in all generated invoices and credit notes. The pre-texts and post-texts appear automatically in the unposted invoices and credit notes either before or after all other lines. They can be saved for all customers and task sites, contracts and jobs. Waste transfer notes can be called up for the customer by clicking on the Waste Transfer Note icon. According to the Ordinance on Waste Recovery and Disposal Records, the waste transfer note identifies that the company has a permit to handle the intended waste management of hazardous waste material. Therefore, the waste transfer note is not a record of the correct disposal of a waste material; rather, it is the official permit to handle the waste management of a specific quantity of a specific waste material in a specific way. Customer contracts and sales orders can be called up by clicking on the Contracts and Sales Orders icons. This brings up a filtered list of these documents associated with the customer. All sales order editing functions are available here. Users can view a list of service errors by going to Navigate Sales Service Errors . The Service Errors function can be used to document service errors related to an order in the corresponding ledger entries. A practical example of this would be a customer who orders the pickup of pure construction waste, but in fact delivers contaminated construction waste, which has an impact on the waste management costs and the waste management method. In such cases, users should not simply change the service number in the sales order; rather, this should be described as a service error, so that it can be statistically analyzed by sales and operations."

    "title": "Automatic commitment application | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Automatic commitment application General From time to time it is necessary to apply the remaining obligation of commitments which have not been fully processed. Depending on the task and work flow, the waste management sector solution provides three different possibilities: Commitments summary being taken over by the suggest commitments Application of the commitments through generation of orders Application via Commitments application journals Application via suggest commitments The current balance of the faded in commitments is also shown in the order on calling the suggest commitments. If the dialogue is confirmed with \" OK”, only the Commitment No. is taken into the field of the same name on the order line . If the dialogue is confirmed with the option \"incl. quantity\" the current balance is also carried over to the order line so that the commitment is fully applied when posting the line. The content of the commitment automatically determines where the quantity is transferred to. If the content is \"service\" then the commitment balance is validated into the field Quantity of the order line. If the content is \"waste material\" then the balance is transferred into quantity to be managed (quantity of the waste entry) etc. Application via order creation Another possibility for automatic application involves generating orders via which the remaining balance is entered. For this it is necessary that the commitment is allocated directly to a contract. This allocation occurs via the fields Contract No. and if necessary Sub Contract No. on the register posting of the *commitments card .* If a contract is consigned to a commitment, then automatic application via the batch processing Kontingente über Vertrag ausgleichen is possible. This batch processing can be called via the Menü enwis services/commitments/Tasks/periodic activities/apply commitments via contract or from the commitment card via the link Actions Functions apply commitments via contract . The batch processing creates orders from the contracts or subcontracts with which the commitments to be applied are linked and thereby transfers the current remaining balance automatically into the quantity field of the order line which enables the commitment to then be balanced on entering the order. The same logics apply for the reference between quantity application in the order and content of the commitment as for the taking over of the commitment balance from the suggest commitments in the order. The field Apply Automatically on the register Buchung of the commitments card does not mean that only commitments in which this field is ticked can be applied automatically. It only provides one filtering possibility for the batch processing which can be used by the user. Application via commitments application journals) The third possibility for automatic application of the remaining balances of commitments is provided by the commitment application journals in the menu commitments . These are structured analogously to the inventory or throughput journals. Via the button calculate commitments balance a batch process is called which creates the journal lines from the current balances of the commitments to be calculated. These journal lines are calculated automatically in such a way that each commitment was zeroed on entry. Depending on the commitment balance this can mean that a relief from the remaining obligation or a subsequent obligation for an overfulfilled commitment is created."

    "keywords": "Chart of Commitments Accounts General Information The current status of all commitments can be viewed in the Chart of Commitments Accounts. The Chart of Commitments Accounts shows all posted liabilities and discharges. Clicking on the Entries icon will bring users to the underlying commitments entries and – if these were automatically generated from the sales order – from there they can go to the causal invoice ledger entries, waste ledger entries, equipment ledger entries, transport ledger entries, or personnel ledger entries. The Chart of Commitments Accounts only shows the commitments with the commitments type Content. In addition to the Quantity (Acc.) column, two other fields can be shown: Quantity Liable (Acc.) shows the total quantity of all entered liabilities Quantity Discharged (Acc.) shows the total quantity of all entered discharges. Users can understand the Quantity Liable (Acc.) as the budgeted quantity of commitments, so that the juxtaposition of liability and discharge enables them to directly compare the original agreement with the current degree of fulfillment. The Chart of Commitments Accounts offers all the functions of a default table of accounts in Business Central. For example, subtotals can be show that summarize the quantity of various commitments. This is particularly useful when there are different commitments with the same content type; by showing the commitments subtotals, users can immediately and transparently see the total quantity of liabilities for this content type (e.g. a certain quantity of product to be shipped or waste material or a number of hours of service to be rendered). The Chart of Commitments Accounts offers an additional feature that other tables of accounts do not have: Accounts can be reassigned. What this means is that the assignment of accounts to certain larger categories, and with it the creation of subtotals, does not have to take place based on the Commitments No . Commitments accounts and their sums can be shifted to a chart of accounts. To do so, use the Adjust Commitments Accounts in Periodic Activities under the Commitments tab. Note that, depending on the number of commitments entries they contain, it might take some time to shift one or more accounts."

    "keywords": "Commitments Due Date General Information It is the nature of commitments that they have to be met within a specific time frame. Example: The company signs a contract with a customer to provide 360 hours of service in the coming year. This service commitment will be posted as a liability as of the start of the year. However, the company probably cannot decide for itself when to provide the hours. For example, it cannot send 360 employees on January 1 to work for one hour and discharge the liability. It might be the case that only 30 hours per month may be applied to the liability and all surplus hours are neither applied to the following month nor do they contribute to discharging the liability. This can be depicted in various ways. One option is to enter the commitments liabilities and their discharge entries into a Commitments Journal with dates in the Due From Date field and the Due Until Date field. In contrast to using Commitments Journals, due dates cannot be entered manually for automatic postings from the order. Therefore the option has been set up to store a Due From Calculation and a Due Date Formula in the fields with the same name under the Posting tab. When a calculation has been stored, the due from calculation and the due date will automatically be calculated based on the posting date using the formula on the commitments card. The due date formula can also be used when posting the commitments liabilities from the contracts. Here the quantity listed on the contract line can automatically be allocated to multiple commitments entries with different due dates based on the quantity allocation rules and contract term, instead of posting them all to a single commitments entry."

    "keywords": "Allocation Parameters Allocation Parameters When creating concept allocation lines, additional parameters can be entered that will also be considered when the concept allocation is executed. When the Transfer Dimensions box is checked, the dimensions (e.g. cost center, cost object) will be copied over from the original line to the allocation line. Similar functions are available with the Transfer Quality Code , Transfer Waste , and Transfer Equipment fields, which will signal the system to copy over these dimensions from the original line. This transfer can be critical, because these fields might pertain to the invoices. Whether these parameters will be transferred normally depends on whether these fields are used for informational purposes or for invoicing purposes. One particularly important feature is the option to enter a process type in the allocation line that will then be copied over to a field on the order line with the same name. For one, this allows users to flag order lines as not relevant to invoicing, so that they will instead be posted to invoice ledger entries to process ledger entries. For another, information can be generated for external accounting and error allocation. The Set Inv. Qty. by Qty. to Disp. field defines the default setting for the Quantity field in the allocation line. This function is available for the content types waste material and equipment. This makes it possible, for example, to allocate a transport service billed to the customer as a lump sum to a fractional service, which will adjust the invoice quantity ( Quantity field) in the created allocation line to equal the fractional quantity ( Qty. to Dispose field). In this example, the following lines must be create: Concept allocation line Line with the concept type \"Service\", an allocation type and allocation agent number, and perhaps an allocation unit of measure code, if it differs from the original line Line with the concept type \"Waste Material\", an allocation type, allocation agent number, and invoice quantity The same value must be set in the Quantity % field in the two lines to be allocated to. The system will set the process type of the created allocation line to , so that the line will be flagged as To Invoice = YES and it can be invoiced."

    "title": "Allocation Quantity Reference Type | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Allocation Quantity Reference Type Commitment vs. Ledger Entry One particular strength of concept allocations is that they can be automatically associated with commitments. When posting quantities to a concept. e.g. Interseroh or DSD, these usually refer to stock movements rather than commitment movements. Many IT systems treat these (e.g. Interseroh quantities) as inventory quantities, but this distorts the actual inventory. Quantities depicted using concepts represent a kind of subledger accounting. Example: A half-empty container is picked up with 2 going to cardboard and 1 to construction waste. These are the quantities that have to be posted to inventory. Regardless of the real inventory quantity, however, this transaction obligates the waste management company to deliver a quantity of cardboard equal to the bulk weight of the full container to Interseroh, for example. The latter has nothing to do with the actual inventory. Instead, a commitments liability has emerged. Consequently, enwis offers an option whereby allocation does not automatically create a waste ledger entry but rather a commitments entry. These commitments entries are assigned to the customer for which they are posted. In addition, they can be assigned to a specially named commitment. This assignment can be automated by entering a fixed commitments number and, if necessary, a sub-commitments number on the concept card . Alternatively, the commitments number can be entered on the concept allocation line. This allows various commitments to be addressed automatically in the same allocation, if necessary. The Allocation Qty. Ref. Type field on each concept allocation line defines whether actual entries – e.g. stock movements – or commitments are generated. When the Allocation Qty. Ref. Type field is set to \"Commitments\", then concept allocation applied to this line will only create commitments entries. This is the system default setting."

    "title": "Pile Density Allocation | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Pile Density Allocation Pile Density Allocation One special case among the complex concept allocations is the option to automatically allocate pile densities. Normally, the concept allocation in the Content Type and Allocation Content Type fields is the same, i.e., services are allocated pro rata to services, waste materials to waste materials, etc. This works differently for pile density allocation. In order to set up the system to automatically calculate pile densities using concept allocation, the content type \"Equipment\" can be allocated to the allocation content type \"Waste Material\". When this is done, equipment entries will generate waste material entries whose weight is determined using the pile density of the equipment. The basis for this automatic conversion includes: Capacity of the equipment used ( Calc. Volume cubic meters ) on the equipment card The Specific Gravity or Specific Volume of waste material saved in the conversion table ( enwis Services Waste Materials Administration Conversion Table ) The waste material saved in the Allocation Content No. field of the concept allocation line or, if this field is empty, the waste material number in the order line The following concept allocation has been entered: In addition to allocating the service, all of the waste material in one container should be converted according to the pile density. Note If an exception should be made and not all of the waste material should be converted, then the Quantity % field must be set to a value < 100. When the concept allocation is generated in the sales order ( Actions Function Create Concept Allocation) , enwis automatically copies the values stored in the master data for the volumetric capacity ( Calc. Volume (cubic meters) ) of the equipment and the Specific Gravity and the Specific Volume of the waste material and uses them to determine the pile density allocation. enwis has copied the values in the Specific Gravity and the Specific Volume fields of waste material 100101 and the Calc. Volume (cubic meters) field of equipment 2005 to calculate the pile density of 0.0075 tons for the order line to be generated through the concept allocation. Equipment can only be automatically allocated to waste material when a value > 0 is set in the Quantity % field of the concept allocation lines. The logic available for this can also be very useful for purposes other than strict concepts. The following example illustrates this: When users set the line to be allocated to (that is, the order line containing the concept number , the concept allocation line without allocation content type or allocation agent number ) so that a quantity of 100% of the content type \"Equipment\" should be allocated to the allocation content type \"Waste Material\", then a waste entry will also be generated for the line to be allocated to. By doing so, the concept logic can be used to automatically generate a waste entry with a specific waste material in the amount of the pile density without having to weigh a container when it is picked up and entered into inventory."

    "keywords": "Cyclic Document Creation – Cycle Logs Cycle Logs All actions the system takes while automatically executing the Create Cyclic Documents function in batch processing are documented and saved in the form of cycle log entries. Cycle logs are created that can be used to completely track and edit a cycle after the fact. Users can call up and use cycle logs and all associated functions directly after running a cycle from the statistics window or later by going to enwis Order Processing History Period Activities Cyclic Document Creation Cycle Logs . The cycle log list shows all cycles ever run, including their log number, date, time, user ID and type. The Type field indicates whether the cycle was used to create documents or a positive calendar. The cycle log entries give a comprehensive overview of all activities execute during the cycle. The system documents who initiated what activities, and when the system began and ended them. All sales orders created and all errors causing individual sales orders to not be created are listed clearly and explicitly. In addition, the information is saved in a format that can be filtered, e.g. using the Contract No. and Document No. fields. Furthermore, the system generates and saves statistical information regarding the quantity of created documents. The various kinds of information can also be filtered by the type of content (statistics, error, beginning or end) using the Status field. Users can go directly from the individual log entries to the associated documents. The screen shot shows the complete log entry for cycle C00007. The list includes the log history in an easy to read, hierarchical format. It shows, for example, that a preview was created and the users did not change any data in the preview. After that, there is an exact list of which sales orders were created from which contracts and which next cycle date the underlying contract was set to. One entry is flagged as an error in the Status field. No documents were created automatically from contract DV00013 because customer 01905899 in this contract has been blocked for new orders in the meanwhile. It is now up to the users how they react to this information. Either the customer block is completely correct or the account needs to be unblocked. In either case, the users know the reasons in detail why the document could not be created. Let us return now to the cycle logs. All documents, contracts, contract lines, and equipment entries that are part of the cycle are flagged with the corresponding cycle log number and can thereby be called up from the cycle log, viewed, checked, and processed. Take note, however, that not all functions will be available forever. The created sales orders will eventually be processed, merged into the combine invoice, and then removed from the system. The contracts will eventually form the basis of the next cycle and are then associated with that cycle log number. By way of the cycle log entries, however, users can track which actions were executed during the cycle and what were their results. By going to Navigate , users can call up the documents created through cyclic document creation, including the sales orders, purchase orders, completed orders, sales invoices, purchase invoices, sales credit notes, and purchase credit notes. By going to actions functions users can call up Print Cycle Plan and Reset Cycle Log functions. The Print Cycle Plan function allows users to print a cycle plan for a current cycle log after the fact. In this case, users must also keep in mind that this list will only be complete as long as the cyclically created documents remain in the system. A cycle plan can also be printed from the Cyclic Documents function in batch processing after the fact using the virtual start date. Using the Reset Cycle Log function, users can reverse the entire cycle with the touch of a button. All created documents will be deleted and all updated contracts will be reset to their status before the cycle; this will mainly affect the Cycle Log-No. , Last Cycle Date , and Next Cycle Date fields. Note Like the other functions, this function will only affect all of the created document as long as they are still in the system. As long as this is the case, multiple cycles in a row can be reversed. When the result of a cycle is reset, this is flagged in the associated cycle log entry under the Reset field. Here users can see whether a contract has been reset, whether only a document was deleted, or whether both occurred. As mentioned above, the Reset Cycle Log function can also be executed for previous cycle logs. When the cycle log to be reset is not the most current cycle log, however, the system issues a warning to this effect that users must confirm. When calling up the Reset Cycle Log function, users have the following options: Reset Log and Delete Documents Reset Log Delete Documents Here users can specific whether only documents should be deleted, only the log entries in the contracts should be reset, or both actions should be executed, which is definitely the most practical option. Note If, during the course of batch processing cyclic document creation, ledger entries are posted directly from equipment entries because the setting on the cycle card signaled the system to do so, these cannot automatically be reset or reversed using the reset function."

    "keywords": "Cyclic Document Creation: Task Create Positive Calendar Positive Calendar When creating positive calendars, the system does not assume cyclical contracts (or contract lines or equipment entries); this is the sole exception to the rule for cyclic document creation. No documents are created here. Rather, a positive calendar will be created or continued and it can be saved to a cycle method with the Positive Calendar time type for generating cyclic documents. Only existing positive calendars (that may be empty) will be filled. The scope of the positive calendar to be edited can be limited by the Calendar Filter field under the Positive Calendar tab in Batch Processing. Such a calendar is also useful for customer information about task dates that run over longer periods of time. This records information in the system, in the form of a calendar, without already creating sales orders. The advantage is that the positive calendar grants users a very easy to follow, easy to edit overview of the task dates over a longer period of time (e.g. a year's overview of the planned household and bulk waste tours). This information can be published in advance or sent to the customers. These task dates can be easily understood and modified by users. They grant an exact overview in advance of all task dates that fall within a specific period of time. None the less, no sales order has been generated, because it might be disadvantageous for dispatching and sales order creation to create sales orders for an entire year that would then stay in the system unprocessed for a long time. Concrete sales orders set long in advance using the positive calendar will then be created one after another for the next week, the next fortnight, the next month or even the next day. Positive calendars are defined by going to enwis Services Administration Cyclic Document Creation Cycle Calendar . The Calendar Type can be positive or negative. When positive calendars are created, the system will only recognize cycle calendars explicitly labeled as positive calendars in the Type field. A cycle must also be assigned to the calendar in the Cycle Code field. It defines the calculation method according to which the calendar lines will be automatically calculated beginning on the start date. Certain prerequisites must be met before positive calendars can be created. In addition, there are some setting options available in the batch processing field Create Cyclic Documents . Users will find these under the Positive Calendar tab. First of all, the two date fields, Cycle Date from and Cycle Date to under the Options tab must be filled in to precisely define the period of time before positive calendars can be created. Under the Calendar tab users also have the option to specify the first and last calendar date to be observed. These should normally specify the same period of time already defined in Cycle Date from and Cycle Date to fields. The difference between these is that the date filter under the Options tab limits the next cycle date, which might very well result in a new document being created outside the date limit. Setting the calendar date filter truncates these dates. Users must define the routine to be run with positive calendars under Task . There are positive calendars with no dates at all and some that already contain dates. When the Create setting is chosen, dates will only be copied to positive calendars that do not already contain dates, i.e. empty positive calendars. When the Add setting is chosen, dates will only be copied to positive calendars that already contain dates, i.e. those that are no longer empty. The Create an Add setting allows the system to copy dates to all positive calendars and is normally the most practical setting. Note A new positive calendar does not have to be set up each year. Imagine, for example, an empty calendar for household waste disposal. Users can have all of the dates set up for the year 2012. The following year, it is not necessary to create a new calendar. Simply use batch processing to insert these dates into the calendars for years 2013, 2014, etc. This way, users always have a coherent overview of the pre-planned sales order dates for this period. **If a calendar is set up for any time type other than Positive Calendar, the system will interpret it as a negative calendar. In other words, if users set up a calendar but select a Time Type field setting that is not Positive Calendar, then the system will automatically treat these calendar dates as a negative calendar.** Such a negative calendar might, for example, include public holidays and the times when the customer's company is closed and no task should occur. Defer Automatically Automatic deferment can also be defined by saving calendar codes. A calendar code in the Positive Calendar time type contains all information regarding when sales orders should be created. After the system calculates a task date (when using the time type Relative (weekly), Relative (monthly), Daily, or Absolute), it checks whether this date might be blocked by a negative calendar entry. If so, then the task date is automatically deferred until the next possible date and flagged accordingly. In this case, the settings in the Include Saturdays and Include Sundays fields are also relevant for the relative time types. When these boxes are checked, the next possible task date might fall on a Saturday or Sunday, otherwise it cannot. When the Defer if Bank Holiday in Week box is checked, the system will check whether the current day is a bank holiday (i.e. present in the negative calendar) and whether there was another bank holiday earlier in the same week. If so, the task date will be deferred by another day. However, this function only works with the Relative (weeks) time type. When any of the other time types is selected, the Defer if Bank Holiday in Week field is faded."

    "keywords": "Cyclic Document Creation: Task Create Documents Create Documents Creating documents is, in fact, the original purpose of batch processing. Using system logic, new documents are created automatically from contracts and the next cycle date is raised. When batch processing is initiated with the Create Documents task, all contracts will be reviewed, the documents to be created will be created, and the cycle date of the contracts will be updated. Note Depending on the number of contracts to be reviewed and documents to be created, this process make take some time. The system issues an ongoing update on the screen showing the contract currently being processed. During processing, the tables are blocked for an extremely short time, so that users should not notice any impairment in system performance. The cycle log number will be written onto all documents generated during the current cycle. This number will also be copied onto all contracts whose information was changed during the cycle. Furthermore, all actions will be documented in the form of cycle ledger entries. Once all contracts have been processed and all documents created, the system can show a quantitative overview of the batch processing. These statistics can be viewed in the same form under the Statistics tab where the initiator for the batch processing was defined. These statistic can shown the following values, for example: On the statistics screen, users can see that the number of the cycle just executed in the Cycle Log-No. field (ZL0000026), the number of sales orders created from the existing contracts (4), and whether some sales orders were not created (x). Users can go to Navigate for immediate access to all data and information associated with this cycle. They have the following options: Print the cycle plan Show the cycle ledger entries (= cycle log) Show and potentially edit the created documents (contracts, sales orders, tours, completed orders, invoices, and credit notes) Reset the entire cycle (function = Reset Cycle-Log) Note In this respect, take note that nothing burdens the performance of a database as much as the deletion or reversal of large-scale actions like resetting a cycle. We strongly recommend taking preliminary steps, such as using the preview function to ensure that the desire information will be created, and taking the time needed to define the filter criteria correctly, rather than running and resetting a cycle back and forth. The cycle log can be viewed in the Cycle Log-Entries menu. Users can read the cycle log to see why a document was not and could not be created (e.g. because a customer was blocked for new orders in the interim) and which contract was involved. The menu items under Sales and Purchasing , i.e. from Sales Order List to Purchase Credit Memos , grant users direct access to all of the documents created during the current cycle. These can be processed directly. The menu items Sales Contracts and Purchase Contracts bring users to the contracts from which the documents in the current cycle (ZL0000026) were created. The Reset Cycle-Log option commands the system to reverse all of the actions taken during the cycle. Note If users intend to reset the entire cycle, this should be done as quickly as possible, because otherwise the documents created thereby might be modified by dispatching, sales order post-processing, invoicing, etc."

    "keywords": "Cyclic Document Creation – Task Preview Preview When batch processing is initiated with the Preview task, the system first generates a list of all documents to be created, as though the Create Documents option had been selected. This is a list of sales orders that do not actually exist: a preview list. This list is shown on the screen as a form. Some points on it can be edited. For example, users can change the task date and thereby defer the sales order. They can also delete individual lines from the list. Users can print a cycle plan directly from the preview by clicking on the Print icon. Any changes made by users will already be incorporated when the list is printed. From the preview, users can decide how the system proceeds. If they close the preview, the suggestions (including any edits) will be discarded. No changes of any kind can be made to the database. Under the General tab in Cycle Preview, users have the option to define other tasks, as they do under Create Cyclic Documents when starting batch processing. When users select the Create Documents task and click on OK, the cyclic documents will be created from the preview list. All changes made by the users will be incorporated. If users select the Print Cycle Plan task, the system will only print the cycle plan. Note Changes to the information in the cycle preview only affect the documents to be created, not the underlying contracts. For example, documents are created on March 27, 2013 and consequently the next cycle date in the contract will be set to April 3, 2013; deleting the document line (in the preview) with the task date of March 27, 2013 would prevent this sales order from being created but it would not change the next cycle date in the contract, which will still be set to April 3, 2013. The system logic assumes that the cycle is not supposed to be changed, merely that the last sales order should not be executed, by exception and for whatever reason. When one considers the preview logic, it makes good sense in general to proceed through Create Cyclic Documents in batch processing in two stages: First, initiate batch processing with the Show Preview task. In the preview, users can still decide whether to select the Create Document task afterwards or to discard the results in the preview. In addition, users have the option of deferring the document creation task date manually. The important actions during the cycle are documented and saved in the cycle log entries. This also documents when and if a preview as started and when it was ended again. In addition, the system documents whether the preview information was accepted unchanged or changed beforehand. Defer Task Dates Automatically As mentioned above, the system automatically defers task dates according to the logic set in the cycle code. This is normally when a task falls on a bank holiday. When the calculation function finds a next task date that is blocked, either by a negative calendar in the system or the settings in the Include Saturdays and Include Sundays fields on the cycle card, the task date of the sales order is deferred until the next possible date. Automatic date deferment is very useful, especially during the Easter and Christmas periods, when several Sundays and bank holidays fall in a row and the dates therefore need to be reviewed and perhaps manually corrected. To help dispatchers immediately spot a critical date, automatically deferred task dates are flagged as Deferred in the list."

The possibilities of the influence which the user has on the manner in which this routine works are very great and they are presented below. Among other things the user can: limit the time period for which documents are created determine whether a preview is to be displayed make changes to the data in the preview before the documents have been created print out an overview of the cyclically created documents or only create this print out for the purpose of pre-testing without actually generating the documents to have a positive calendar generated in place of documents all actions of the cyclic document creation are jointly recorded in clear text. A series of errors (if e.g the new application of a document is not possible as the customer was blocked in the meantime) are retained and also recorded for later tracking. the complete cycle sequence can be taken back once again with a click The dialogue to the start of the cyclic document creation provides a complete series of possibilities for parametrisation which are presented below. Note The settings on the register Options remain saved by user while the default settings on all other registers are reset for each call up of the batch processing. The individual registers and fields are investigated below: Register Options Via the fields Cycle date from and Cycle Date to it is defined which cyclic contract (or contract lines / equipment entries) are in the viewing window of the batch processing. Only contracts with an entry in the field Cycle Code and a date in the field Next Cycle Date are taken into account by the batch processing. An entry in the field Cycle date from, is absolutely required while the field Cycle date to can be left. Both windows together define the time horizon (the viewing window) of the batch processing. In the current example a time window is defined which does not have a start and ends on 07.11.2013. This corresponds to the date filter 07.11.2013*.* All contracts are taken into account if their entry in the field Next Cycle Date is less than or equal to 07.11.2013. Instead of an end date in the field Cycle date to , a maximum number of next tasks which are to be created can be indicated in the field Number of Tasks. Then all task data for the number of next tasks are calculated by contract or contract component. If both an end date and a number of maximum tasks are indicated, orders are generated or calculated until one of both arguments is reached. Via the field Range it is possible to specify how many documents are created with the following options available: All Documents Next Document Example: The next cycle date 30.10.20103 is defined in the contract DV00012. In the cyclic code the time form Relative (weekly) and the interval 1W are defined. In the characteristic \"Next document\" a document with the task date 27.03.2013 is created and the next cycle date of the contract is moved up to 06.11.2013. If the field Range has the option All Documents selected in the batch processing then all documents up to the end of the time period defined by C ycle date from and Cycle Date to are generated. In the above example that would mean: From the order with the next cycle date 30.10.2013 documents are generated consecutively with the entry date 06.11.2013, 13.11.2013, 20.11.2013 and 27.21.2013. Subsequently the field Next Cycle Date goes onto 04.12.2013 in the contract. The user uses the options summarised under the point Task to establish what the batch processing is to achieve. The following four options are available: Create Documents Print Cycle Plan Create Calendar Preview These options do not in principle rule each other out. They can partially be processed in various batch sequences one after the other. In this way the printing of the cycle plan can also occur for example after the documents have been created. In addition the user can have a preview displayed and decide from the preview how to proceed further, whether e.g. documents are to be created, a cycle plan printed or the preview is to be discarded. The points are described in more detail in separate documentation. In the field Proof next cycle date it is possible to set whether the next cycle date (thus the first of the current cycle) is checked and corrected where necessary or not. The value of this field is always pre-allocated by the value of a field of the same name in the Waste management setup/Register contract. Register Contract register The contracts which are to be taken into account in the cycle sequence have already been restricted via the fields Cycle Date from and Cycle Date to on the register Options . It was restricted to those contracts which show specific values in the field Next Cycle Date . On the register contract there are further possibilities to set filters for the batch processing. The following filter possibilities are present: Cycle filter Posting type Business-with No. Task-at code) Job No. Site code Order type Contract No. Ext. Contract Line Filter In the example above only contracts which show the cycle code WEEKLY are taken into account. Register Defaults If the Boolean field Keep Cycle Date is ticked and new documents are to be created from contracts then these documents are created on the basis of the next cycle date. The field Next Cycle Date is however not updated in the contract but remains on the original value. For a new cycle sequence documents would be newly created for the same task date. Register Statistics If all contracts are processed and all documents are created, a statistic can be displayed which first of all provides a quantitative overview of the batch processing carried out. These statistics can be viewed on the register Statistics of the same form on which the definitions for the start of batch processing are also consigned. These statistics can have the following values for example: The information that the cycle sequence just carried out has the cycle log number (ZL0000022), that (5) new orders have been generated from existing contracts and any (x) orders were not created can be taken from the statistics window. Via the link navigate there is immediate access from all data and information which are linked with this cycle sequence: The user has the following possibilities: Printing of the cyclic plan Display of the cycle ledger entry (= cycle record) Display and possible processing of the documents generated (contracts, orders, tours, completed orders, invoices and credit memos) Reset of the complete cycle sequence which was just generated (function = reset cycle log) Note In this context it is however pointed out that nothing burdens the performance of a database as much as numerous deletion actions. It is thus recommended that it is ensured, preferably in advance - via the preview if necessary - that the desired data are generated and time is consciously taken for the definition of the filter criteria rather than carrying out the cycle generation and cycle reversal a few times. Cyclic documents from contracts It is possible to use the menu point Create cyclic documents to call up the batch processing for creation of the cyclic documents directly from a contract. An automatic filter is set onto the current contract. Via the menu point Show cyclic documents it is possible to display the next 10 task data directly from a contract. No RequestForm is displayed and the next 10 deadlines are directly calculated and displayed. The function sequence starts the routine for creation of the cyclic documents with a filter on the following values: Current contract Number of tasks = 10 Range = Preview"

    "keywords": "Cyclic Document Creation – Setup General Information Users must set up the Cycle Log-Nos. field under the Numbering tab in Invoice Setup before they can work with cyclic document creation. In the Sort Cycle Preview by field in Waste Management Setup they can save the criteria to be used for the preview of sales orders on the monitor before creating the actual documents. The following options are available: Contract Task Date Business Partner Business Partner Site This preview can be printed out. If an individual report is used instead of the default report, it can be specified in the Cycle Preview Function field. As this report only prints out temporary information, it must be defined by a code unit. The code units are set up as Type = Cycle by going to Equipment Setup Waste Mgt Calculation Function . When cyclic document creation is used to fill out ledger lines, the corresponding ledger must be entered into the Cycle Equip. Jnl. Template and Cycle Equip. Jnl. Batch fields in Waste Management Setup . Cycles – Setup Cycles in enwis are methods for the system to determine the next processing date from the saved date. Cycles can be set up according to any number of user-defined criteria and defined according to individual calculation routines. Example: Beginning on a specific start date, the system should create a new sales order from a contract each week. In the contract, the start date is set as January 8, for example. When running cyclic document creation, the first document will be created from the contract on January 8 and the next date for automatic document creation will be set to January 15 based on the underlying calculation method. Users can define cycles by going to enwis Services Setup Cyclic Document Creation or to enwis Sales Orders Rents Rent Cycles . Any number of cycles can be defined. The number of possible definitions is so vast that it should cover all situations that might present themselves in practice. There is a broad range of control mechanisms and logic available to users for specific, automatic date calculation. The basic settings are saved on the cycle card under the General tab. All of these options will be explained in detail below. Time Type The central logic behind the cycle method is set in the Time Type field. The following options are available: Relative (monthly) Relative (weekly) Daily Absolute Positive Calendar Explicit Relative (monthly) This time type assumes that the task date will be repeated at a specific interval of one or more months. When using this time type, the next cycle date will be determined primarily on the settings in the Interval field and those under the Weekdays tab. The date formula in the Interval field will determine whether the cycle repeats monthly or at an interval of more than one month. Users can enter as many months, quarters, or years in this field as they wish. The date formula 2M, for example, would mean that the sales orders are only created every second month. The day of the month when the sales orders should be automatically created is defined under the Weekdays tab. In the example above, users have defined that a sales order should be created in the second week of the month on Tuesday and Thursday and in the fourth week of the month of Wednesday and Friday . Relative (weekly) This time type assumes that the task date will be repeated at a specific interval of one or more weeks. To determine the next cycle date, Relative (weekly) must be set in the Time Type field. An interval of 6W, for example, would mean that a sales order will be generated every six weeks. How many days of the week a sales order should be automatically created on will also be defined under the days of week tab. In this case, however, only the days in \"Week 1\" are material. The definition in \"Week 1\" applies to all weeks when sales orders should be automatically created according to the defined interval. In the screen shot above, a sales order will be created on Monday , Wednesday , and Friday in those weeks determined by the interval setting. Daily The Daily time type defines that sales orders should be created in a rhythm measured in days. In this case as well, only the days in \"Week 1\" under the days of week tab are material. It is not necessary or possible to enter a date formula in the Interval field, which is faded to indicate so. When using the Daily time type, sales orders will automatically be created on each day checked under the days of week tab (though if no days are checked, then no sales orders will be generated). Note When the same days of the week are checked, then the Daily time type and the Relative (weeks) time type with an interval of 1W will lead to the same results. Absolute When using the Absolute time type, the date formula entered into the Interval field is the only thing that matters to determine the rhythm. Users can enter intervals such as 3D (= 3 days) or 2M (= 2 months). The next cycle date will always be calculated in absolute terms based on the previous one. It is not necessary or possible to check any of the boxes under the days of week tab in this case. Note The difference between the Absolute time type with an interval of 1M and the Relative (months) time type with an interval of 1M is as follows: When using the Absolute time type, the week date of each task shifts from month to month. In addition, only one task day can be defined by this rhythm, not several fixed weekdays. The Include Saturdays and Include Sundays fields influence how the system should behave when the task date would fall on a Saturday or Sunday. When using the Absolute time type, the calculated task date could fall on a Saturday or Sunday, though enwis can automatically push it back. For example, if the Include Saturdays and/or Include Sundays boxes are not checked, when using the Absolute time type, if the task date were to fall on a Saturday or Sunday, enwis would automatically defer the task until the next possible date. Example: The time type is set to Absolute and the Include Saturdays field is not checked. If the calculated task date were to fall on a Saturday, the system would automatically defer the task until the following Sunday or, if the Include Sundays box is also not checked, to the following Monday. Note All deferred task dates are automatically flagged by the system so that dispatchers can quickly identify this and review or edit it.** Positive Calendar The Positive Calendar time type is an extremely interesting alternative where the system regularly recalculates the interval. A calendar can be saved in the Calendar Code field for each cycle. When the Positive Calendar time type is selected, sales orders will be create for all dates saved in the positive calendar, and only on these dates. The positive calendar can be set up manually. Instead of creating documents, automatic document creation can create positive calendars completely automatically. One possible procedure would be as follows: At the start of the year, a positive calendar of task dates for the entire year is automatically created. This positive calendar can then be reviewed and manually edited if necessary. This calendar now serves to inform customers of all task dates in the coming year, for starters. It also determines the cycle. After all, individual sales orders for the entire year have already been set up. This cycle, like all other cycles, can now automatically create sales orders for a period limited by the users, whereby it successively works through all of the dates saved in the positive calendar (instead of calculating new ones each time). A sales order is created on each date saved in the positive calendar assuming it falls within the current cycle. Sidebar: Negative Calendars If a calendar is set up for any time type other than Positive Calendar, the system will interpret it as a negative calendar. In other words, if users set up a calendar but select a Time Type field setting that is not Positive Calendar, then the system will automatically treat these calendar dates as a negative calendar. Such a negative calendar might, for example, include public holidays and the times when the customer's company is closed and no task should occur. Automatic deferment can also be defined by saving calendar codes. A calendar code in the Positive Calendar time type contains all information regarding when sales orders should be created. After the system calculates a task date (when using the time type Relative (weekly), Relative (monthly), Daily, or Absolute), it checks whether this date might be blocked by a negative calendar entry. If so, then the task date is automatically deferred until the next possible date and flagged accordingly. In this case, the settings in the Include Saturdays and Include Sundays fields are also relevant for the relative time types. When these boxes are checked, the next possible task date might fall on a Saturday or Sunday, otherwise it cannot. When the Defer if Bank Holiday in Week box is checked, the system will check whether the current day is a bank holiday (i.e. present in the negative calendar) and whether there was another bank holiday earlier in the same week. If so, the task date will be deferred by another day. However, this function only works with the Relative (weeks) time type. When any of the other time types is selected, the Defer if Bank Holiday in Week field is faded. On Demand The On Demand time type will not trigger any automatic calculation. The only purpose of using a cycle with this time type is to flag contracts for later sales-related recording. Individual Calculation Functions The Calc. Function field is the last one relevant to date calculation. An entire user-defined function can be saved here to be used for calculating the next task date. It can be a completely individual code unit with all programming options offered by Business Central. This procedure is not recommended, however. The logic already developed into the system should be enough to cover all business situations. Creating Document Types The Create Document Type field defines which type of document enwis should create for which cycle method when using cyclic document creation. Normally, contracts are the basis for creating sales orders, but they are not the only option. The following options are available for the Create Document Type field: Sales Orders Completed Orders Invoices Credit Notes Contract Journals Ledger Entries A sales order, a completed order, an unposted invoice, an unposted credit note, or a new contract can be created automatically from a contract or a contract line. The automatic creation of contracts can be used in situations where contracts with a customer are extended or renegotiated each month or each year and each time a new contract number should be set up. This way, it is not necessary for users to set these contracts up manually. Documents created cyclically can be generated from both contracts and parts of contracts, namely, the contract lines and contract entries. When a cycle code is saved to a position, this can either generate a ledger line or directly create a posted ledger entry. Example: When a container should be dropped off or picked up according to a specific cycle, but this drop off or pick up should not be invoiced, or should be managed as an independent sales order and only the container rental should be invoiced by its laid-up time, it sufficient to fill a ledger entry from the equipment entry in the contract and to then post it, or to post the equipment entry (which the container rental should later be calculated from based on the laid-up time) directly. These procedures are not set up in the system as sales orders, however, and therefore cannot be dispatched. The From Contract Lines field defines how the system should act when a sales order is not to be created from an existing contract but rather from a contract line. There is an option for copying the contract header to the order header ( Option = Transfer Contract Header) or for generating a new order header from the contract line ( Option = New Contract Header ). The New Contract Header option is practical when several different customers and/or vendors and customer and/or vendor task sites are summarized within one contract. First Week of Month The First Week of Month field defines which week will be considered the first in the month: the first week in which Monday falls within the current month (Option = Complete ) or the first week in which any day falls within the current month (Option = Part ) When users choose the Part option, the first week of the current month might begin in the previous month. When the Cumulative option is chosen, cyclic document creation occurs on the absolute first weekday in the current month. Example: April 1, 2013, falls on a Wednesday. When users choose the Part option, the system counts March 30 and 31, 2013, to the week of April 1. When the Complete option is chosen, the week beginning on Monday, April 6, 2013 is counted as the first week of April. With the Cumulative option, documents are created on the absolute first weekday in the current month. If the Tuesday Week 1 box is checked under the Weekdays tab on the cycle card and the First Week of Month field is set to Kumulativ, then documents will first be created on Tuesday, April 7, 2013. Note When using the Relative (months) time type, different days of the week can be set under the Weekdays tab for each week in the month when sales orders should be automatically created."

    "keywords": "Definition of cyclic contracts Definition of cyclic contracts In order to start cyclic runs, first of all it is necessary to mark individual contracts, contract lines and/or contract entries as cyclic. Only contracts and contract components to which a cyclic code and a start date for the first cyclic run are assigned are incorporated into a cyclic run. Example: The contract DV00012 was given the cyclic code WEEKLY . In addition the start date (the date on which a document is to be automatically created from this contract) is entered in the field Next Cycle Date . In this case the 27.03 is entered in the order line as the next cycle date. This consignment is only necessary once. From now the user only starts the batch processing regularly, which generates the cyclic documents. The contract shown is taken into consideration for the first time if the start date (30.10.2013) is in the time period for which the batch processing runs for creation of the cyclic documents. This then generates the document according to the rules which are defined in the cyclic code WEEKLY and from these rules it also calculates the date on which the next cyclic document is to be generated automatically. This date is then written back in the field Next Cycle Date. In the cyclic code WEEKLY the time form is Relative (weekly) and the interval is defined. The application would then generate a new document on 30.10.2013 from the contract DV00012 and set the field to 06.11.2013. The contract card would look as follows following the cyclic run: The date on which a document was generated automatically from the contract is also written in the field Last Cycle Date for information purposes. In addition the log number of the cyclic run which was the last to be initiated by a document generation is written back in the field Cycle Log-No. The fields named are present in the contract header, the contract lines and on the equipment entries."

    "title": "Merging Cyclic Documents | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Merging Cyclic Documents General Information Cyclic Documents can be merged when they are created. Normally, cyclic document creation generates one sales order per cyclical task date. When the merging function is used, for example, all cyclic documents pertaining to one contract can be merged into a single sales order. This reduces the number of sales orders in the system. Users should consider each job carefully before deciding whether to use this function or not. In generally, it is only practical to use this function when it appears to be inevitable. This function is not as practical for waste management companies, because they usually want to create a sales order for each task. For companies that mainly act as brokers, and for workflows where sales orders are not created until after execution in the system, merging documents into one can be beneficial, because users need not switch back and forth between sales orders so frequently to process them. For invoicing, it does not matter whether the services come from one sales order or are allocated among many. For cost accounting, it is clearly better to not merge documents but rather to work with individual sales orders, because this allows users to analyze product costing for each one. The following general statements apply to merging cyclic documents: Only sales orders can be merged, not completed orders, invoices, etc. Only documents created using the cycle code in the contract header or the contract lines can be merged, and these are generally done separately. In other words, sales orders created from contract lines cannot be merged with sales orders created from the contract headers. The services in a merged sales order document are sorted by task date. Setup The Create Cyclic Documents function under the Default Register for batch processing defines whether cyclic document creation will work with document merging or not. The settings in the Merge Cycle Orders by and the Cycle Merging Active for fields are material here. The following four options are available for the Merge Cycle Orders by field: Cyclic Documents will not be merged. When this option is selected, the Cycle Merging Active for field cannot be edited. Contract No. All cyclical orders generated for the same contract will be merged into one sales order. Business Partner All cyclical orders created for the same business partner (customer or vendor) will be merged into one sales order. Business Partner Site All cyclical orders created for the same business partner site (= customer task site or vendor task site) will be merged into one sales order. The Cycle Merging Active for field can be used to restrict the applicability of the merging function. The following options are available: Contract Header Only documents created using the cycle code in the contract header will be merged. Contract Lines Only documents created using the cycle code in the contract lines will be merged. Both Documents using the cycle code in the contract header and the cycle code in the contract line will be merged. However, two separate sales orders will be created, one for each. When users call up the cyclic document creation function, the system normally copies the settings from the Merge Cycle Orders by and Cycle Merging Active for fields under the Contract register in Waste Management Setup to the eponymous fields in cyclic document creation. Users can see in the cycle log that several sales orders have been merged."

To avoid the high susceptibility of errors, enwis offers the document templates. Document templates will guide the user step by step when creating documents through a wizard which would make the job much easier for the user. This can be achieved in enwis by defined document templates and variables (placeholders) for each business transaction. Once the template is setup for each business case, from this template the user will be able to create the necessary documents along with its variables. The value of a variable such as Quantity of waste to be discarded or Number of Equipments to be handled can later be entered in that actual document itself."

    "title": "Determining an invoice method | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Determining an invoice method General In enwis it is possible to establish rentals on the basis of different calculation methods. These different calculation methods are known as Invoice method in enwis. With the help of the invoice method the parameters with which the rental time period is to be established are determined. These parameters include e.g. the number of days which are actually to run into the rental time period, the information regarding whether a daily or monthly rental is to be calculated etc. The set up of an invoice method is described in detail in a separate document. First of all it is necessary to clarify how the suitable invoice method is established. The establishment of an invoice method occurs analogously to the establishment of an inventory account via a matrix, namely the rental invoice matrix. The combination of different criteria in the rental invoice matrix leads to the desired invoice method. Rental Invoice Groups The rental invoice group code is a central criterion in the rental invoice matrix. This can be issued by customer, vendor, customer task site, vendor task site or project. The rental invoice groups can be set up via the following menu path enwis services/equipment/Administration/Equipment Rentals/Rental invoicing/rental invoice groups The rental invoice group is consigned on the customer/vendor card in the field Rental Invoice Grp. Code on the register Invoicing as shown in the following image. On the customer/vendor task site card this also occurs on the register Fakturierung . On the project card this allocation occurs on the register general . In the selection of the correct rental invoice group, enwis proceeds in line with the following hierarchy: Project in front of customer/vendor task site in front of customer/vendor. Equipment Group) The equipment group code is an additional criterion for establishment of the invoice method via the rental invoice matrix. Equipment groups can be set up via the menu path enwis Services/Equipment/Administration/setup/groups & matrices/equipment group Each equipment item can be allocated to one of the equipment groups defined here. The allocation occurs via the field Equipment Group. on the register general of the equipment card. Rental Invoice Matrix In the rental invoice matrix the various criteria can now be used to consign combinations from which enwis establishes an invoice method automatically. The rental invoice matrix can be called up under enwis services/equipment/Administration/Equipment Rentals/Rental invoicing/rental invoice matrix but also from the customer/vendor card, the customer/vendor task site card and from the project card. In addition to the criteria rental invoice group and equipment group already named, the matrix can also have the posting type, the equipment number (of a concrete equipment item rather than just the equipment group), the service group code and the start date consigned as relevant criteria to the invoice method fixing. The logic is to be seen as analogous to the pricing. In the example above all commercial customers who rent a skip get the invoice method MONTHLY while the private customers who rent a skip get the invoice method DAILY. Note If all customers are to receive the same invoice method for all containers, it is sufficient to apply a single data record which has an entry in the field Invoice Method Code and for which all other fields otherwise remain empty. Number of rental invoice and equipment groups A question in the implementation of enwis is how many equipment group codes or rental invoice group codes there should be. The response depends on what the establishment of the invoice method is primarily based on. For the simplification of just two invoice methods let us assume an invoice according to daily rental (DAILY) and an invoice according to monthly rental (MONTHLY). In practice there could be the following scenarios: The establishment of whether a daily or monthly rental is calculated depends on the customer/vendor (or additionally on the customer/vendor task site or on the project). In this case it would make sense to apply two rental invoice group codes (DAILY and MONTHLY) and only one equipment group code or none at all. Of course it is also possible to set up several equipment groups in order to make distinctions at another point in the operational business but not to apply rental invoice matrix lines for these and instead to leave the corresponding field empty. <!-- --> Rental invoice group code = DAILY Equipment group code = DEFAULT or Invoice method code = DAILY Rental invoice group code = MONTHLY Equipment group code = DEFAULT or Invoice method code = MONTHLY <!-- --> The establishment of whether a daily rental or a monthly rental is calculated depends on the equipment. In this case it would be suitable to apply just one or no rental invoice group and two equipment group codes (DAILY and MONTHLY). In the rental invoice matrix there would then be both the following entries <!-- --> Rental invoice code = DEFAULT or Equipment group code = DAILY Invoice method code = DAILY Rental invoice group code = DEFAULT Equipment group code = MONTHLY Invoice method code = MONTHLY If the customer/vendor or the equipment is not exclusively responsible for the establishment of the invoice method, the set up of the rental invoice matrix becomes somewhat more complex. Such a complex set up always occurs if e.g. customer A (rental invoice code = A) always gets a daily rental calculated with the equipment group code SKIP and a monthly rental with the equipment group MGB. The customer B (rental invoice code = B) always gets a monthly rental in connection with the equipment group SKIP and always an annual rental with the equipment group MGB. In this case the rental invoice matrix would have a much broader scope <!-- --> Rental invoice group code = A Equipment group code = SKIP Invoice method = DAILY Rental invoice group code = A Equipment group code = BOX Invoice method = MONTHLY Rental invoice group code = B Equipment group code = SKIP Invoice method = MONTHLY Rental invoice group code = B Equipment group code = BOX Invoice method = YEARLY In practice the customer/vendor or the equipment is not exclusively responsible for the establishment of the invoice method and the combination of these criteria is decisive instead. Therefore it is urgently recommended that the establishment of the invoice method is schematised in a very flexible and comfortable way via the matrix. In the individual case the establishment of the invoice method can however always be overruled. The invoice method can also be consigned in the order or contract in the field of the same name in the equipment entry. An invoice method entered here does in each case have priority over the invoice method which is established via the rental invoice matrix. The same applies on posting of an equipment item via the equipment journal."

    "keywords": "Equipment Card Setup Associated with Invoicing Setup There are certain fields on the equipment card relevant to invoicing that have to be kept up-to-date. The Equipment Grp. field on the General tab is involved in determining the invoice method. Each piece of equipment can be assigned here to defined equipment groups. Combined with a rental invoice group code, the rental invoice matrix is use to determine an invoice method for the current business case. Other settings can be adjusted on the Application tab that will have a material, indirect influence on the rental invoice by controlling the equipment stock application and thereby initiating the invoice. Let us first take a look at the Costing Method field. Practical experience has shown that the \"Application\" option is the best choice here. This forces users to manually flag an application each time equipment is moved. If the application is not executed, the posting is interrupted with the error message \"Applies to Entry No. cannot be 0\". Automated application methods (FIFO, LIFO) are possible, of course, but practical experience shows that they easily lead to uncontrolled stock application and thus to incorrect invoicing. Example: Equipment submission (MO05) on 06/06 and on 08/06. **Pick-up of one container on 10/06.** According to the invoice method, the first two days are not billed. If the first container is picked up, there are two billable days. If the second container is picked up, there are no billable days. This little example quickly illustrates that automated application using one of the conventional costing methods does not make sense. As can be seen, when using the \"Application\" application method, users are always forced to manually flag an application each time equipment is moved. This would mean, however, that the first Submission would also have to be flagged with an application, which is not logically possible. This is why there is an Application Skipped On field where users can indicate that certain equipment movements do not need to be flagged with an application. In practice, this is usually the Submission, because equipment is normally dropped off and then picked up."

    "keywords": "Equipment invoice reference General The rental invoice does not have to occur via the same customer as the provision or waste management service which is linked to the receptacle provision. The logic can be selected by the user. The Source No . of the waste management ledger entries, equipment ledger entries, transport ledger entries and personnel ledger entries is in principle established from the field Post-with No. of the order line. An invoice is additionally established from the equipment. Therefore it is necessary to distinguish between the quantity flow ( Post-with No.) in the equipment ledger entries and the value stream ( Invoice-with No. ) in the rental value entries. The fields Source No. in the equipment ledger entries and Post with No . in the rental value entries are in principle filled from the field Post-with No. of the order line. The fields Source No. in the rental value entries and Post-with No. in the equipment ledger entries are by contrast in principle filled by default setting from the field Invoice-with No. from the order line. The user does however have further options to establish the invoice. On the register rental invoice of the Invoice Setup it is possible to consign in the field Rental Invoice with whether the equipment ledger entry should in principle be entered and invoiced with the field Invoice-with No. or with the field Post-with No. These defaults can however be overridden for each individual entry in the equipment entry in the field Rental Invoice with. The options of the field Rental Invoice with in the equipment entry are: : The settings in the field Rental Invoice with on the Invoice setup apply Invoice-with No.: Entry takes place with the field Invoice-with No. of the order line Post-with No.: Entry takes place with the field Post-with No. of the order line In this way it would also be possible exceptionally or in principle to invoice the equipment entries of services with a different invoice recipient via the original service recipient instead. Invoice sub-address Via the invoice sub-address additional invoice addresses can be consigned to the customer which are different to the actual customer address (e.g. the addresses of customer task sites). These alternative addresses must not be confused with those which are consigned in the field, Bill-to Customer No. in the order line . In the field Bill-to Customer No. another customer is defined as invoice recipient . Alternative addresses for the sending of invoices are consigned via the invoice sub-address.

The invoice sub-address of an order line, with which the provision is entered, can be transferred into the rental invoice line of the resultant rental invoice. The following conditions must be met: The option field Rental Invoice with must have the option \"Invoice-with- No.\". on posting the provision. This option field can be set in the Invoice Setup and overruled by the field of the same name at every equipment entry. The field Transfer Inv. Sub. Address must be ticked in the relevant invoice method of the rental invoice. Rental invoices must be created as completed orders and not as invoices which have not been posted.

    "keywords": "Equipment ledger entries and rental value entries General Equipment ledger entries and rental value entries where appropriate develop either from an equipment entry which was applied to an order line or from an equipment journal line. On posting the equipment entry (on clearance of the order) or the posting of the journal line, two types of entry develop, namely an equipment ledger entry and a rental value entry. The equipment ledger entry represents the actual quantity movement of the equipment (the inventory). The rental value entry is the basis for the invoicing of a rental (the invoice). Inventory movements and invoices can be separated clearly through the two different entries. This is exactly what occurs in practice: The current equipment inventory with the customer and the invoices of the equipment rental are virtually never congruent and they run separately to one another according to temporal and content logic. Example: Lets us assume we post a submission on 09.01 with the invoice method MONAT. Within the invoice method it is stipulated that a rent is to be calculated once per month for a month. This means that the next rental calculation would be possible on 31.01 for the first time. Let us look at the most important fields of both entry tables following posting. Betriebsmittelposten (equipment ledger entry) First of all the equipment ledger entries which present the physical inventory: Let us look at the most important fields of the open equipment inventories in more detail: (not all fields are displayed in the image). Entry Type: Here a distinction is made between Submission, Pick-up, Exchange and Clearance in the operational area Document No .: If an equipment ledger entry is generated via an order, the order number will be here or otherwise the document number which is entered manually via the journal. Start Date: Date on which the process actually takes place (e.g. the provision). The start date can be independent of the posting date Source Type, Source No. and Source Site Code : These fields correspond to the fields Posting type (sale/purchase), Post-with No. and Customer Task Site of the order line or the fields of the same name in the equipment journal. From there they are transferred into the equipment ledger entries Equipment No.: Container / receptacle which is physically located on site Rental value entries Let us now look at the table rental value entries (not all fields are shown in the image). Note Before the decisive fields for calculation of the rental are investigated, here is a short explanation on the terminology. The fields Source Type, Source No. und Source Site Code are also present in the rental value entries table. Logically they have a slightly different meaning adapted to the differing function of both tables: Source Type: Is filled analogously to the equipment ledger entry table Source Site Code : Is filled analogously to the equipment ledger entry table Source No.: Customer from the field Invoice-with No. Post.-with No.: Customer from the field Post-with No. from the equipment ledger entry Decisive fields for the calculation of the invoice period are as follows: Invoice Method Code: This is established from the rental invoice matrix and written on the entries. This can be input directly into the equipment entry or the journal as preferred. It then has a higher priority than the invoice method which is consigned in the rental invoice matrix Invoice Status: The value \"Billable\" must be set in this field so that the rental value entry is taken into consideration in the rental invoice. This is always the case if the tick is placed in the field Billable in the underlying invoice method Next Invoice From)** :** On the basis of the parameters consigned in the invoice method, the next, earliest possible invoice deadline is calculated and entered here. In our example the equipment was placed on 09.01.2013. The rent is to be calculated once a month. This means that the next invoicing date is 31.01.2013 Invoice calculated until: If a completed order or a posted invoice has occurred for this ledger entry through the rental invoice, the date up to which the rental has already been calculated is entered here. In our example we would have a completed order with an invoicing period of 09.01.2013 - 31.01.2013 through the rental statement. The 31.01.2013 would then be entered in the field Invoice calculated until . Invoice until*:* If the aforementioned order is fully invoiced (i.e. there is an invoice posted for this entry), this field is filled with the value from the field Invoice calculated until . So here we have 31.01.2013 Changing of a rental value entry through the rental invoice In order to make the changes clearer we only look at the four fields named above. The starting point was the entered provision of 09.01.2013 and the next possible invoicing date 31.01.2013 (not all fields are shown in the image). The rental invoice is started via the link enwis invoicing combine invoicing rental Invoice . The fields Invoice Date, Posting Date and Task Date on the register Options of the rental calculation are particularly important for the creation of the rental invoices - both with the value 31.01 in the example. Invoice Date: Date on which the rental invoice is to be started. The current date is e.g. 28.01.2013, the next rent may only be calculated from 31.01.2013 in our example. If 31.01.2013 is posted in the field Abrechnungsdatum, the rental can be calculated in advance Posting Date : Date on which the rental invoice is to be entered (general ledger entry date) Task Date: A dispatching date for a rental period does not initially appear particularly meaningful. Let us however assume that our customer wishes to have his waste management and rental services shown on one invoice per month. He thus generates completed orders for his waste management services. These all have a dispatching date, namely the day on which the service was performed. In addition he creates a completed order for his rentals. In normal combine invoicing the customer enters a limitation for the month of January (dispatching date 01.01.2013 - 31.01.2013). If the rental order did not have a notional dispatching date, all the rental order lines would not be captured by this filter. This means that the input of a notional dispatching date (usually the end of the month) can definitely be meaningful for the purposes of limitation. It is possible to select whether the rental invoice completed orders or invoices which have not been posted is generated by customer/vendor in their invoice layout in the field Invoice Transfer into on the register Rental Invoice . The following completed order has been generated: This order is now processed completely up to the posted invoice. Following creation of the posted invoice the rental value entry looks as follows. Three changes in the rental value entries have resulted from the creation of the posted invoice. The field Invoice Status was moved from \"Billable\" to \"Partly Invoiced\" as the equipment was not yet collected and thus will be invoiced at least once more. The field Invoice until was filled with the value from the field Invoice calculated until as the rental is no longer just calculated but already posted. The field Next Invoice from was newly calculated on the basis of the parameters consigned in the invoice method (monthly calculation, last calculation up to 31.01.2013, thus next invoice from 28.02.2013)."

    "keywords": "Rental Invoice Layout Setup Under the Rental Invoice register in the invoice layout for customers and vendors, users can define the settings that will influence the appearance of the rental document. Below we take a look at the relevant fields in detail: Report Type Rental Invoice: A separate report type code (unlike the report type code of the customer) can be saved for the rental document to be created. This only makes sense when an unposted invoice is to be created through rental invoicing, because the general report type code takes priority to the equipment report type code in the combine invoice. Rental Invoice Sorting by: This is similar to normal invoice sorting in combine invoicing. On Rental Inv. Sort Change : This is similar to normal invoice sorting in combine invoicing.

Show Rental Period: If this box is checked, the start date and the end date of the rental period is shown in an additional line when the rental document is created. These two pieces of information can also be flagged as pre-text and intermediate text. For this to work, users must go to Navigate Texts Additional Texts Rental Invoice and enter these values in the Pre-Text field (e.g. \"rent from\") and Post-Text field (e.g. \"to\"). Invoice Transfer into Completed Orders : This option is the default setting and is always practical when customers or vendors want both the waste management services and the rental services in one invoice. All completed orders for the customer or vendor are summarized into one combine invoice. Invoice Transfer into Unposted Invoices: This option is always practical when customers or vendors want the rental services on a separate invoice. Even the waste material projected for the rented container can be relevant to the rental invoice. This is always so when the Incl. Exp. Content in Invoice box under the Service tab in the invoice method is checked. In this case, the waste material and its description are automatically copied as additional text lines to the rental invoice document. The additional texts can be called up by going to: Navigate Texts Additional Texts Rental Invoice Note that these additional texts are not copied until the unposted invoice is created. If the Invoice Transfer into field in the invoice layout under the Equipment tab specifies that the rental invoice should result in completed orders, any waste material descriptions will not yet be copied to them. These will be automatically generated during the subsequent combine invoice, so they will be in the invoice in any case. If the Invoice Transfer into field instead specifies that the rental invoice should result in unposted invoices, then any waste material descriptions will automatically be copied to them."

    "keywords": "Rental Invoices – Potential Sources of Errors General Information Certain phenomena and related FAQs appear regularly in practice and they are related to typical user errors and settings that are not correct for the desired results. We will take a short look at these below. No rent is being calculated. The user has forgotten to check the Billable box in the Invoice Method , so the equipment ledger entries are never released for invoicing. The Rental Value Entries Next Invoice from field in the Invoice Method is set to create the next invoice as of 30/06 but the Calculate Rent field under the Options tab is set to a date before 30/06. The rent calculation has already been executed and was never undone. Although the rent for May was calculated, no rent can be calculated for June. A new rent calculation cannot be initiated until the rental document for May has been completely invoiced. enwis is calculating rent beyond the end of the month. The date of rent calculation entered under the Options tab is probably not the end of the month to be invoiced but rather a day at the beginning of the following month. The consequence of such an error is that, if the system uses an invoicing interval of one month, the next possible invoice date will also be pushed back. Example: In the rental value entry, 30/06 is the date set in the Next Invoice from field. The rental invoice is executed with the posting date of 03/07. This creates a rental period from 01/06 to 04/07, which ignores the maximum invoice period. Because the invoicing interval is set to one month, enwis calculates the next invoice date to be 04/08. Consequently, the periods continue to be delayed."

    "title": "Rental Price Fixing Matrix | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Rental Price Fixing Matrix General Information In the business of renting containers, it is not uncommon in practice to drop off a different container (e.g. a larger one) than the one ordered, because the latter was unavailable at the time. This should not have any negative repercussions for the customers. When the equipment number is relevant to determining the rental price, then the system will have to use a different equipment number than the one of the actual equipment dropped off to charge the right price. Users have two options for doing so. They can enter a different equipment number than the one associated with the actual equipment in the Rental Price Fixing Equip. No. field of the equipment entry and the system will reference this variant number when setting the price. This variant equipment number is relevant to invoicing and it will be transferred to the rental value entry. To provide users with all of the information they need, the equipment entries offer an automatic calculation function in the Rental Price Fixing Equip. No. field. If no equipment number for the invoice has been entered here manually, the system will reference the rental price fixing matrix and show the equipment number for the equipment to be referenced when setting the price. This is merely a reflection; there is no actual value in the field. To visualize the contrast between a value entered manually and one placed there from the rental price fixing matrix for informational purposes , the latter is shown in angle brackets. The equipment to be invoiced can also be determined automatically from the rental price fixing matrix. This matrix is accessible from the equipment card and here invoiced equipment can be saved for any combination of job, customer or vendor, task site, quality code, and equipment, and this will be used in place of the equipment actually dropped off to set the price for the rental invoice. In principle, equipment entered manually and written to the rental value entry has priority over one taken from the rental price fixing matrix. In other words, if there is a value in the Price Fixing No. field of the rental value entry, this will be used to set the price, and not the rental price fixing matrix. Setup It is also possible to set in the Invoice Method whether present or ascertainable, alternate equipment can even be used to set prices. The use of the rental price fixing matrix and alternate equipment that will be transferred to the Price Fixing No. field in the rental value entry to determine the rental price is set in the Use Rental Price Fixing field on the I** nvoice Method Card **. The following three options are available for this field: Option Explanation Always enwis attempts to determine equipment for pricing that varies from the equipment dropped off. It first refers to the Price Fixing No. field in the rental value entry and, if this is empty, it automatically looks to the rental invoice matrix for the equipment number. If it finds alternate equipment for pricing in this manner, the system will use it to set the rental price (default setting). When Pre-set | Alternate equipment will only be referred to if it has been set in the Price Fixing No. field of the rental value entry. The rental price fixing matrix will be not be used to determine alternate equipment. Never | Alternate equipment is never used, not even when it has been saved in the rental value entry. Note : When, during rental invoicing, a different price has been determined in the rental document line based on different equipment for pricing, then the setting in the Price Fixed field of this line will be changed to \"Yes\". The rental price fixing matrix is only relevant for calculating the rental price and is not used to calculate service prices during normal order processing."

    "keywords": "Reversing Rents Undoing Executed Rental Invoices Depending on the settings in the invoice layout, when the rental invoicing is run, the system creates either a completed order or an unposted invoice. The following three scenarios might arise: After the completed order has been created but before this sales order has been processed further through combine invoicing, users notice that something is wrong with the generated rent. In this case users can simply delete the completed rental order. Changes to the rental value entry automatically made through the creation of the completed order are then automatically undone. After the completed order has been created and after this sales order has been processed further through combine invoicing, users notice that something is wrong with the generated rent. In this case, users must first delete the corresponding rent line in the unposted invoice (or they can delete the entire unposted invoice) and then continue as explained in the scenario above. As in the previous scenario, changes to the rental value entry automatically made through the creation of the completed order are then automatically undone. If an unposted invoice is created directly, this can be deleted just like a completed order. This undoes all changes to the rental value entry. Reversing Rents How users should proceed when equipment ledger entries or rental value entries need to be reversed depends on which of the following cases applies. Case 1: No rent has been calculated for the entries When this is the case, users can simply post a reversal in the equipment ledger. To do so, click on the Reverse Entries icon to call up this function. A list will appear will all equipment ledger entries that are still open. Select the entry or entries to be reversed and confirm by clicking on OK. The selected entries then appear with reversed signs in the Quantity field in the ledger and can be posted. The related rental value entry is automatically reversed as well. Note This only works if no rent has been calculated.** Case 2: Rent has been calculated for the entries When this is the case, the equipment ledger entry cannot be reversed as it was in Case 1, because the related rental value entry has already be changed by the rental invoice. Here there are two steps to reverse the entry. Step 1: Reverse the rental value entry To do so, find the Open Equipment Rental Invoice form in the Equipment menu. This page has a list of all open rental value entries. Once the rental value entry to be reversed has been found and selected, click on the Change Status icon or F9 to call up this function. When the screen appears (this screen is also used to change rental information), enter the following settings: Select \"Invoicing Cancelled\" and check the Reversal box, then confirm these settings by clicking on \"Yes\"; otherwise, they will not be applied to the entries. enwis**)** then sets the Invoice Status to \" Invoicing Cancelled \" and flags the rental value entry as reversed.

    "title": "Setting up an invoice method | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Setting up an invoice method General Invoice methods are set up and maintained in the menu Equipment via the menu path enwis Services/Equipment/administration/equipment rentals/rental invoice/invoice method among other places. As an example an invoice method TAG is set up, meaning that the invoice should occur by the day. The following fields can or must be filled in. General register The most important fields on the register general individually: Code : Input of a self-explanatory name or a designation for an invoice method (example: DAILY) Description: Inputs of a description for the invoice method (example: daily rental, 3 days rent free) Free of Charge Period (once): Input of a unique invoice free period in days Example: If the business partner is not invoiced for the first three days of the first rental period for example, a 3 can be entered in this field. If an equipment item is supplied on 01.01 and collected on 10.01, this would result in 10 days, three of which are uniquely not to be calculated. enwis does in this case thus only calculate 7 days. Free of Charge Period (always): Input of a constant invoice free period in days Example: If the first three days of each rental period are not invoiced to the business partner, the field Free of Charge Period (always) can have a 3 inserted. An equipment item is provided on 01.01 and collected on 10.02. For an invoice interval (see below) of a month there would be two invoice periods, namely from 01.01 to 31.01 and from 01.02 to 10.02. enwis would in this case only calculate 28 days for the first period rather than 28 and only 7 days for the second period rather than 10 days. Invoice Submission Day: Definition of whether the invoice day is to be invoiced. Values between 0 and 2 are possible. Invoice Pick-up Day : Definition of whether the collection day is to be invoiced. Values between 0 and 2 are possible. Invoice Zero Quantities (invoice zero amounts): Definition of whether an invoice line is to be created by the rental invoice if the rental time period is actually 0. A tick should always be placed in the field Invoice Zero Quantities as the user can on the one hand recognise that enwis has calculated a rent but that this has a value of 0 due to the invoice free period for example. On the other it is recorded with regard to the business partner that a rental payment would be due but that this is not calculated. Example: An equipment item is provided on 01.01 and collected on 03.01. In the fields Free of Charge Period (once) or Free of Charge Period (always) 3 days are entered. A rental time period of 0 days results which is also issued on the invoices. Billable : Placing a tick in this field makes the invoice method billable. It would only make sense not to place a tick at this point if there was a desire to track the equipment provided by quantity but not to generate rent. Invoice Saturday : Definition of whether Saturday is to be invoiced. Values between 0 and 2 are possible. Invoice Sunday: Definition of whether Sunday is to be invoiced. Values between 0 and 2 are possible. Full months in days : In practice container rents are frequently calculated in such a way that calculation is in principle calculated precisely to the day while a fixed number of days (usually 30) is in principle set for full months while the days of months broken up by provision or collection are added precisely by the day Example: Provision 7. January 2012, collection 14. March 2012. The daily calculation now occurs so that the exact number of days is calculated for January and March while a fixed 30 days (full month) are applied for February. As the rental days are calculated in this way, a value > 0 must be consigned in the field full month in days. According to practical experience this is as a rule 30 but a different value could be consigned instead. Calendar code : With this it is possible to consign a completely individual calendar. It is possible to use this calendar for each individual day of the year to define whether and with which factor this day plays a role for the rental calculation. In this way it is possible to take e.g. public holidays, school holidays or company holidays of certain customers into account automatically so they are not charged or charged at a lower rate. Consider Starting Time und Consider Finishing Time : For equipment with a particularly high value which is rented or rented out by the hour rather than the day, it may be necessary to use the time of the provision and/or collection in order to enable an exact invoice. Register Interval The most important fields on the register interval individually: Start Interval : This field is used to determine when the first rental calculation may occur. Example: Let us assume a monthly calculation of the rental. The equipment was provided on 07.01.2013. The first rental calculation is now to follow on 31.01.2013. For this purpose it is necessary to enter the value LM for laufender Monat (running month) into this field. This makes a rental calculation to 31.01.2013 possible. If 1M is entered in this field, a calculation would only be possible on 08.02.2013. Invoicing Interval : This field is used to determine the time period (following the start interval) according to which a rental may next be calculated. Example: Let us again assume provision on 07.01.2013 and a start interval of LM. The invoice interval is to be 1M, meaning the rental is to be calculated once per month. The first rental calculation is possible on 31.01.2013 as already described above. After the rental calculation has been posted the next possible invoice date is set to 28.02.2013 on the basis of the setting 28.02.2013. Invoice after Pick-up : If a tick has been placed in this field, a rental can only be calculated once the equipment has been collected regardless of the settings in the fields Start Interval and Invoice Interval. Max. period inv. after pick-up : This field is used to determine how many days or months may be invoiced continuously. _Example:_ In the case described above, a first rental calculation on 31.01.2013 would be possible. If calculation of the rental on 31.01.2013 is forgotten and a rental calculation only occurs on 30.06.2013, then it depends on the setting in this field whether the rental is calculated continuously from 07.01.2013 to 30.06.2013 (would be possible for a 6M setting) or whether a separate rental calculation is created for each month (would happen for a setting 1M). The rental invoice for the month of January would then have to be entered completely before a rental invoice for February could be generated. _Subm./Pick-up in invoice period :_ The abbreviation stands for maximum invoice period invalid following collection Example: Let us use the above case as a starting point. The rental up to 31.01.2013 was calculated and already posted completely. A following calculation is possible on the basis of the invoice interval of 1M on 28.02.2013. A maximum invoice period was also set at 1M so that a rental can only be calculated up to 28.02.2013 as a maximum. Now it is possible that the equipment was collected on 04.03.2013. For our example this means that two rental calculations would occur. Namely from 01.02.2013 to 28.02.2013 and from 01.03.2013 to 04.03.2013. If a rental calculation is now initiated on 03.03, enwis already knows that the equipment has already been collected. If the field MAX. PERIODE UNG. N. ABHOLUNG has a tick placed in it, enwis ignores the maximum invoice period and calculates continuously up to 04.03.2013. invoice immediately after : Here it is possible to specify that an item of equipment can be invoiced immediately after collection (= Option Pick-Up ) although the date of the next possible invoice has not yet been reached. With the option \"Part-Pick-Up\" it is possible to specify that an item of equipment which has been provided once can be invoiced immediately after its collection although the date of the next possible invoice has not been reached. All other quantities which have not been collected can continue to be invoiced as usual. _Submission on Exchange : _ This field can be used to specify the effect the exchange of an equipment item has on the invoice. The following options are possible: <!-- --> Start anew : The option has the effect that the exchange is handled exactly as in the receptacle inventory. The previous provision is ended by the exchange, a new provision is started and the customer receives two invoices. _Renew with same equipment :_ In this option the invoice behaves asynchronously to the inventory, meaning that the exchange is divided into a provision and a collection in order to be able to track which equipment item is actually at the customer's premises. This is however ignored in the invoice. The rental period of the exchanged equipment item is continued as if this was not exchanged. The customer receives an invoice. renew : The invoice is only extended if an equipment item is exchanged for the same item of equipment (=same equipment number). If an item of equipment is exchanged for another one (e.g. a 10 cubic metre skip for a 7 cubic metre skip) then enwis automatically switches into the mode \"Replace\" for this process. Keep: The invoice is extended and regardless of the type of the equipment items exchanged in each case. Here the invoice is also extended if the equipment item is exchanged for a completely different one (=different equipment number). <!-- --> Invoice immed. after exchange: If this field is ticked, an immediate invoice is triggered by the exchange of an equipment item. Register Service The most important fields on the register service individually: Service Selection : In this field the options \"Setup, Invoice Method, Ledger Entry and Hierarchic\" are available. These options are explained in more detail below. <!-- --> Setup: If this option is chosen a service must be consigned centrally in the Invoice Setup on the register Rental Invoice in the field Equipment Rental Serices . This consigned service is then used in the creation of the rental invoice line as a rental service. Such a setting does as a rule only make sense if rents are always and exclusively calculated over a consistent period (day, month etc.). Invoice method : If this option is selected, a service can be consigned directly in the invoice method. The fields Sales Service No. and Purchase Service No. serve this purpose*.* Ledger Entry : If this option is chosen then the service from the equipment ledger entries is used in the creation of the rental invoice line. If a provision is created via an order rather than an equipment journal, the service of the order line behind which the equipment ledger entry is hidden is also written into the equipment ledger entry. Hierarchic: If this option is selected then enwis establishes the invoice service in line with the following sequence: <!-- --> Equipment ledger entry invoice method Invoice setup <!-- --> Sales Service No. / Purchase Service No. Here a service can be entered which is then used in the creation of the customer rental order / the customer/vendor rental invoice line. A pre-requisite for this is the selection of the option \"Invoice Method\" in the field service selection . Sales Price Group / Purchase Price Group : At this point a price group code for the rental order / the rental invoice line to be created can be given. This price group code is written onto the invoice line instead of the automatically established price group code. This price group code has priority over all other price group codes established. Calc. Function: Here an individually developed code unit can be consigned which then calculates the rental according to individual, non standardised criteria. This option should in practice be avoided if possible. Service description: There are several options available in this field which are described below. <!-- --> Leave unchanged : The field service selection is used to determine the service which is brought into the rental order/ the rental invoice line. The service has a description and a description 2 where appropriate. This service description is accepted in this option exactly like in the service card. Supplement: This service description is accepted for this option like in the service card but it is however added to with the description of the equipment (equipment card). Replace: The service description of the rental service card is ignored for this option and instead replaced by the description of the equipment. <!-- --> Transfer Bal. Account : If an equipment entry is applied via an order, the counter entry type, the counter entry number and the destination device code are transferred from the order line onto the equipment ledger entry. In the rental calculation this information is written back from the equipment ledger entry into the rental order / the rental invoice. That only happens if a tick is placed in this field. The same also applies for the entry of an equipment ledger entry via an equipment journal. Transfer entry Dimensions : If an equipment entry is applied via an order, then the global dimensions (as a rule cost center and cost object) can be transferred from the order line onto the equipment ledger entry. In the rental calculation this information is then written back from the equipment ledger entry into the rental order / the rental invoice line. That only happens if a tick is placed in this field. The same also applies for the posting of an equipment ledger entry via an equipment journal. Transfer Quality Code: If an equipment entry is applied via an order, the quality code can be transferred from the order line onto the equipment ledger entry. In the rental calculation this information is then written back from the equipment ledger entry into the rental order / the rental invoice. That only happens if a tick is placed in this field. The same also applies for the posting of an equipment ledger entry via an equipment journal. Transfer Site : If this field is ticked (default setting), the original site code with which the equipment value entry was entered (thus as a rule the site code of the order) is transferred into the invoice line of the rental calculation. If the field is not ticked then the rental calculation receives the site code of the user which creates it. Incl. Exp. Content in Invoice: The expected content of a provided container (e.g. paper, wood, construction waste etc.) can be added to each equipment ledger entry. If the field Incl. Exp. Content in Invoice is ticked, this waste type is also invoice relevant. This means: The waste material is transferred into the invoice line and can have an effect on the price fixing depending on the set up of the service price line. The waste description can also be written into the rental invoice document automatically in this context. This is dependent on the corresponding consignment in the fields waste material code and/or waste description on the register additional texts of the invoice layout as is also the case for the normal combine invoice. It must be ensured that these additional texts are only established on creation of the unposted invoice. That means: If completed orders are created within the framework of the rental invoice, these do not yet contain the waste description as additional text parts (it is however created with the subsequent combine invoice); if invoices which have not been entered are created directly within the framework of the rental invoice, these also contain the waste description immediately."

    "keywords": "Setting up a rental service Setting up a rental service Rental services are set up automatically by enwis in the course of the rental calculation and written into completed orders generated by the system itself and they can subsequently be invoiced. They are intended to determine the rental price for renting out a particular receptacle for a particular time period. The service card is called up via the menu point enwis services Lists Rental services : Here the complete functions of the service card are available. The services are however filtered exclusively for rental services. These are defined via the Service Group Code in the field of the same name. The service group which stands for rental services is consigned in the waste management setup in the field Service Grp. Rentals on the register card Processes . New services can also be applied which are also rental services automatically. The rental service requires a time unit. A rental calculation is selected in the above screen shot for example. The unit of the rental service is consigned in the field Base Unit of Measure in the register general and where appropriate differently for customer or vendor business transactions in the fields Sales Rental Invoice UOM and Purch. Rental Invoice UOM in the register Invoicing of the rental service card. Note When applying a new rental service enwis automatically transfers the basic unit into the fields Sales Rental Invoice UOM and Purch. Rental Invoice UOM. Both these fields must be filled in. Otherwise the rental calculation is cancelled with an error message. Following these settings on the service card it is necessary to change into the Waste Mgt. Units of Measure table of the service in order to determine the type of rounding and precision. In the field Rounding Precision a numerical value can be entered, e.g. \"1.00\" in order to round to whole numbers. Note When setting up the time unit please ensure that the corresponding time type was also consigned. The precision of 0.10 indicated in the screen shot means a rounding to the first decimal place. In the option field Rundungsart it is possible to select between the options \"Nearest\", \"Up\" and \"Down\". With the setting shown as an example in the screen shot, time periods between 28 and 32 days are rounded up to a full month; time periods between 33 and 34 days are however rounded up to 1.1 months. Extended rounding function in the rental invoice The rounding options which are available for the equipment invoice are extended by a second stage compared with customary methods. Type of round and rounding precision are consigned in the conversion. For many users however these possibilities are not sufficient. Many users do however in principle wish to calculate in half months only. Every half month which is started either counts or it is rounded commercially so that 1.2 = 1 month and 1.4 = 1.5 months. In order to be able to show this, a second rounding is possible after the actual rounding. This occurs via the fields Interval Rounding Precision und Interval Rounding Type in the waste management unit (hidden in the form in standard). In the field Interval Rounding Precision it is possible to indicate the interval at which further rounding should in principle take place following establishment of the temporally correctly rounded value. In this example an interval rounding precision of 0.5 is indicated. It is however conceivable for every other precision. Via the interval rounding type it is determined whether rounding up to the next interval is to occur, rounding down to the previous one or commercial rounding is to occur, meaning rounding up or down to the next value. Extended Texts The text components of the rental service can inserted automatically in rental calculations. This depends on the setting of the field Autom. Leist.-Textbaust. einf. on the register Service of the Invoice Method Card . The following options are available: Never: Automatic text components are in principle not inserted Optional: The automatic text component is inserted depending on the setting in the master data of the service or the reference catalog. If there is a tick in the field Automatic Ext. Texts Textbaustein, this is inserted and otherwise it is not Always: Automatic text components are always inserted if present, even if the field Automatic Ext. Texts is not ticked. Note If there is a valid reference catalog for the service, then the text components of the reference catalog are used; in addition the setting in the field Automatic Ext. Texts of the reference catalog applies for the option test. If no valid reference catalog is present, the text components of the service are used and the option test applies for the setting in the field Automatic Ext. Texts of the service."

Via the link Home edit rental price by criteria it is possible to establish whether rental prices are present in the system for the intended business transaction. This function also works analogously via the equipment entries of the order or contract with the only difference being that the customer and the other factors are not on the equipment entry but on the order line. With the function edit rental price by criteria the context menu shown in the subsequent screen shot is opened. In addition to the price a start date and a posting type must be input where necessary. It is also important here that the input of prices is confirmed via the switch \"Ja\". Otherwise the changes or the new application are not accepted. The price consigned here refers to the basic unit of the rental service. Rental services must in principle be managed in time units. It doesn't matter whether hours, days, weeks or months are used as a time unit for invoicing. It must be a time unit in each case and a time type must be allocated to this unit. Note The design of this price dialogue is dependent on the definition of the price criteria on the register prices of the waste management setup . Here it is possible to activate or deactivate criteria for the pricing. Only the activated criteria are available for the pricing."

    "keywords": "Application of an equipment service General enwis allows a very flexible depiction of container management and rental calculation. Equipment services can be defined correspondingly flexibly. Equipment services are intended to depict equipment movements, thus the provision, collection, exchange or the emptying of equipment. Whether and to the extent that this is invoice relevant and which prices are linked to it is secondary for equipment services. The primary task of equipment services is to depict the inventory relevant movement of containers. The most important fields for the new application of an equipment service are explained below. General register The following fields should be filled in on the General register. No .: Number which clearly identifies the service and via which this is activated in the order line for example Note In the numbering of services it should be taken into account that a service catalog is often very comprehensive and may easily include several hundred or even thousands of entries. This catalog can be structured with the help of the service numbers. It may therefore make sense not to have services numbered fully automatically by the system on application by enwis and instead to number them systematically and manually so that they can easily be identified by the user. In this way it would for example be recommended to number all waste management services starting with the number 100010 while all equipment services are numbered starting with 200010. Description and Description 2 : Input of free texts to describe the content of the respective service Base Unit of Measure : Input of a measurement unit which is relevant for the internal service recording e.g. unit. The value consigned in the field Basiseinheitencode is transferred automatically to the fields Sales Unit of Measure and Purch. Unit of Measure on the register invoicing. Service Group Code: The option field primarily controls the relationship between operational quantity and invoice quantity. In principle the service type should be aligned to the billable core of the service, i.e. an equipment service should receive the service type equipment more meaningfully because the equipment entry is of decisive significance for the operational processing and also the invoices. enwis interprets the entries in the field Operational Qty . of the document line as indication of quantity about the equipment movement and therefore transfers an input in Operational Qty . into the field Qty to Handl . If the system is set up appropriately this operational quantity is transferred into the invoice relevant field Quantity of the document line and if necessary an equipment entry is applied into which the data present such as e.g. equipment number and the equipment type are transferred. Equipment No .: Input of the respective equipment. Important: enwis does not understand the equipment number to represent a single piece of equipment but a group of identical pieces of equipment. Equipment Type: The type and direction of the equipment movement are stipulated via this option field. The equipment type provision opens a so-called equipment ledger entry which must be closed once again following collection and applied. A relevant equipment type should thus be allocated to all services which are relevant for equipment hire and the system should be set so that the equipment entry is applied automatically so that an equipment ledger entry is generated in each case. Invoicing register The following fields should be filled in on the register Invoicing : Gen. Prod. Posting Group: Consignment of the relevant posting groups so that the proceeds and costs can be recorded on the corresponding general ledger accounts VAT Class: Consignment of the relevant posting groups so that the VAT postings can be posted on the corresponding general ledger accounts Sales Unit of Measure/Purch. Unit of Measure : It is possible to consign unit codes different to the basic unit code via the fields Sales Unit of Measure and Purch. Unit of Measure which are normally used for the measurement of the invoice amount. If invoicing normally occurs e.g. via the unit \"Pieces\" but the unit \"Ton\" is decisive for the stockkeeping, \"Ton\" must be defined as the basic unit of the service while \"Pieces\" can be stipulated as a purchase or sales unit. Cost Center Code: Linking of the service with a fixed cost center Cost Object Code: Linking of the service with a fixed cost object"

    "keywords": "Dispatching plan General The dispatching plan gives an overview about the currently dispatched quantities and it can be called up under enwis services equipment tasks equipment rentals Dispatching dispatching plan . The overview of the dispatched equipment can be arranged according to various periods (day, week, month, quarter, year). The capacities and availabilities are projected analogously with the quantities dispatched over the chosen period form. It is possible to branch out directly to the underlying entries and ledger entries from the sum fields formed on line via the drill down functionality depending on the quantity type chosen. Via the field Quantity Type it is possible to control which quantities per period are to be displayed in the form. If branching out to equipment entries occurs (e.g. for the quantity type Sales Rental) then all relevant parameters (e.g. equipment number, start date etc.) can be changed. These changes occur directly in the dispatched orders and they thus have a direct influence on the presentation in the equipment dispatching. The following options are possible in the field Quantity Type: Sales Rental: the amount of equipment dispatched and provided for the customer for the period selected Purchase Rental: the amount of equipment dispatched for the selected period for leasing at a customer's premises. Stock: Equipment inventory Availability: The availability of the dispatched equipment for the selected period. It is possible to use the field Account Type to control which equipment item is to be displayed. The options are: Chart: All equipment items including the headings and sum accounts of the equipment chart of accounts. Account: Only actual equipment items are displayed and no headings and sum accounts from the equipment chart of accounts.

    "keywords": "Equipment administration Purchase and sale of equipment Equipment can mean an individual item but also a type of which several are present in the warehouse. Equipment inventories are increased by the purchase of equipment and decreased by sales. The inventory postings occur via the Equipment Journals in the menu Equipment. The setting in the field Equipment Type is decisive here: Option \"Purchase (Stock)\": The purchase of equipment for one's own company are shown via this option. This option primarily assists the administration of one's own container inventory Option \"Sales (Stock)\": The long-lasting sale of containers from one's own inventory is shown here, meaning when these containers are taken out of service. The journal lines can be posted via the button Buchen or via the function key F9 . Following posting of the journal line, equipment ledger entries of the type \"Purchase (Stock)\" emerge and the posted warehouse inventory can be viewed in the equipment chart of accounts for example. You can find the equipment chart of accounts at enwis services equipment Reports and analysis Plans and Schedules charts of equipment account By clicking on the corresponding value in the field Stock Qty. you come to the associated equipment ledger entry. Equipment movements It is not only possible to show the purchase and sale of equipment via the option field Betriebsmittelart (equipment type) but also various types of equipment movements. The following options are provided: , Submission, Pick-up, Exchange and Clearance. Option \"Submission\": Equipment ledger entries of the Submission type designate the transfer of equipment to the customer and thus determine the starting point for the calculation of the rental time period. The equipment ledger entry expresses how much equipment is at the customer's premises. The equipment value entry (rental value entry) on the other hand expresses how long the container has been there Option \"Pick-up\": In principle this works just like Submission but in the opposite direction. An equipment entry is applied by the collection and a rental value entry closed. Option \"Exchange\": A Exchange always means both at the same time: Provision and collection occur in one work step. Therefore the total quantitative inventory of equipment remains unchanged for both the customer and the company. enwis nevertheless administers the exchange of equipment internally as a double process of collection and provision. Three equipment ledger entries occur for each exchange: one of the Submission type, one of the Pick-up type and one of the Exchange type. The latter is however for purely informational purposes in order to clarify that provision and collection were accomplished within the framework of an exchange. Option \"Clearance\": While the equipment types Submission, Pick-up and Exchange have a direct or indirect effect on the rental calculation, the equipment type Clearance is completely separate from the equipment rental. Emptying is handling of equipment which can be invoiced as such. As the continuance of the equipment at the customer's premises is however not affected by this, the emptying does not have an effect on the rental time calculation. Availability of equipment Inventories are only available if they are in the warehouse. If the container is dispatched for one day, then it is not only no longer available on this day but also on the next one and the one after that until it is collected. A provision has a negative effect on the inventory and thus leads to a reduction of the quantity available. If a container is collected from a customer's premises, then the inventory is thus increased as is the quantity available. If a container is dispatched for the purpose of emptying, then this has no effect on the inventory and therefore the availability. In the dispatch of equipment the type of dispatch (provision and collection) is thus of decisive importance for administration of the availability. In addition to their own containers, waste management companies often work with receptacles which they have hired and borrowed from vendors. This makes the rental of receptacles into a dispatching task. In the course of dispatch of equipment it must additionally be taken into account whether customer or vendor business is involved. For vendor business the inventory change and therefore the availability behave completely reciprocally to the customer business: a provision (the vendor provides us with a container) has the effect of increasing the inventory, a collection (the vendor picks up his container again) has the effect of reducing the inventory. The availability of an item of equipment is calculated via the following formula: Inventory (= purchase quantity – sale quantity) + dispatched rented quantity (= vendor provision – vendor collection) – dispatched rented quantity (= customer provision – customer collection). The availability overview of equipment can be called from the equipment card via the link Navigate Planning Equipment availability and also in numerous other dispatch relevant contexts. Via the fields Stock Quantity , Sales Qty. Dispatched and Sales Qty. Dispatched it is possible to branch directly onto the underlying equipment ledger entries or to the dispatched equipment entries of the corresponding orders. As long as the user has the appropriate entitlements, direct dispatching changes can also be made directly in the orders."

    "keywords": "Equipment card General Equipment does not just involve repositories and containers but also special equipment (e.g. cameras) which can be loaned to customers. Equipment is administered under the menu item Equipment in the main menu enwis services . New application of equipment Equipment is applied in the menu enwis services Equipment Lists Equipment . The equipment card does not represent a single item of equipment but instead stands for each equipment type. There is the possibility of consigning individual equipment IDs to each item of equipment which then represent a single piece of equipment. These repository IDs can be maintained in the order line or equipment entry via the field ID-Code . A new item of equipment can be applied via the button New ( Ctrl + N ). The most important fields are described below. Depending on the set up, an automatic code or a manual number can be allocated for the equipment to be newly applied in the field Nr. The field Description contains the relevant equipment description. A suitable unit can be selected in the field Base Unit of Measure Codes whereby equipment should in principle be introduced in the unit \"Piece\". The option \"Posting\" must be selected in the field Account Type . The set up in the field Account Type is decisive primarily when equipment charts of accounts are being worked with as this set up allows the presentation of repository movement and inventories of the equipment. In the field Equipment Grp**.** a corresponding equipment group is selected. The combination of the two fields Equipment Grp . on the equipment card and Rental Invoice Grp. Code on the customer card determines the correct invoicing method in the Rental Invoice Matrix . In the field Transport Group Code it is possible to stipulate the transport group by which the equipment is normally transported. This makes the later transport dispatching more straightforward. Repositories can be clearly marked in the field Container in order to isolate these from the remaining equipment such as machines, cranes, presses etc. The field Costing Method on the register card Application should be set to the option \"Application\". With this setting it is ensured that the collection order can only be cleared once this has been settled with the corresponding provision. This setting is particularly important for the rental calculation as the rental calculation starts at the point in time of the provision and ends at the point of collection. Practical experience shows that the option \"Application\" is the best choice here. The user is thereby forced to always provide each equipment movement carried out with an application manually. If no application is made the entry is cancelled with the error message \"Compensation with Ser. No can not be 0\" Automatic application methods (FIFO, LIFO) are of course possible but they can in practice very easily lead to an uncontrolled inventory application and therefore to an incorrect invoice. As just described, with the application method \"Application\" the user is always forced to provide each equipment movement with an application manually. But that would mean that an initial provision would have to be provided with an application which is of course not possible in terms of content. Therefore it is possible to stipulate in the field Application skipped on that certain equipment movements can be excluded from an application. In practice that is as a rule the provision as an item of equipment can in a normal case only be placed and then collected afterwards. On the register card Invoicing , a general product posting group in the field of the same name must be selected. This posting group is necessary to keep the continuous business logic in enwis but it is not linked with the general ledger. It is recommended that a \"Dummy\" product posting group is applied in order to isolate this from the product posting groups of the general ledger."

When posting an equipment entry, e.g. through the clearance of the order, this does not just result in an equipment ledger entry but also a rental value entry for the equipment types provision and collection. The difference between both types of entry is: Equipment ledger entries show the physical movement of equipment, e.g. the transfer of a receptacle to the customer. Rental value entries represent the duration of the stay of the receptacle with the customer and thus form the basis for the calculation of the rental price The dates and times connected with the equipment type are important data for the equipment dispatching and also for the equipment statement. Initially only the fields Startdatum (start date) and Startuhrzeit (start time) are available on the equipment entry. For the equipment type \"Submission\" these are transferred into the fields Startdatum and Startuhrzeit o_f the entry, but into the fields _Endedatum and Endeuhrzeit for the equipment type \"Pick-up\". In the order the equipment entries can be called via the button equipment entries or via the key combination Ctrl + B . The data flow does in principle only run from the line to the entries and not in reverse. This means that inputs on the order line are transferred into the entry but changes made to the entry are not written back onto the line. Application of equipment ledger entries On the register application of the equipment card it is possible to create a set up in the fields Lagerabgangsmethode and Ausgleich aufgehoben bei so that equipment movements with the exception of a provision are only processed further if the user has selected an application entry for this transaction manually. This application can be carried out in both the equipment entry in the order and also directly in the equipment journal via Lookup in the field Applies-to Entry No .

That means: the equipment ID can in principle only be posted in the following quantities: -1, 0, 1. The number of the posting of provisions and collections is not arbitrary. The equipment ID cannot be placed or collected twice consecutively. The exact programme behaviour is dependent on the setting in the field Application skipped on the register application of the associated Equipment Card: If the field Application skipped on has the value \"Submission\", there must first of all be a provision and then a collection.

    "keywords": "Extended Invoice Texts Invoice Pre-Text and Post-Text The Invoice Pre-Text and Invoice Post-Text functions are options for including information. The two functions can be found under the following link: Navigate Sales Invoice Layout Invoice Pre-Text and Invoice Post-Text . These functions allow users to insert invoice text automatically into the invoices they create before and after other elements. This text then automatically appears in the unposted invoice before or after all other lines; the pre-text goes before the column headings and the post-text after the invoice total. In addition to storing invoice pre-text and post-text in the invoice layout, it can also be stored in the customers/vendors, task sites, order addresses, contracts, and jobs. Invoice pre-text and post-text can contain as many lines as desired and be labeled with a starting date. The system will only call on the invoice text closest to the current posting date. Sorting Info The pre-text, intermediate text, and post-text can be defined individually and/or generally in the Invoice Setup under the link Navigate Texts Sorting Info Combine Invoicing or Sorting Info Rental Invoices . The Use Default Sorting Info field under the General tab on the invoice layout card will determine whether the individual invoice layout definitions or the general ones will be used. If this box is checked, then the general texts under Invoice Setup will be used. In the invoice layout, the pre-text, intermediate text, and post-text for the combine invoicing and the rental invoicing is defined under the link Navigate Texts Sorting Info Combine Invoicing and Sorting Info Rental Invoicing . Different text can be stored for each sorting type per language code and site code The Infotext option gives you the possibility to insert a line of information (an 'info line') as a header in the combine invoice document for each grouped sorting criterion. Go to Invoice Layout to design the look of this info line. This info line adheres to the following syntax (though the context may exclude certain elements): Pre-text – Description 1 – Intermediate Text– Description 2 – Post-text Description 1 will be filled by the content of the sorting criterion (e.g. 4711 if that is the service number). In the example above, the following info line text would be generated: - Service 4711 : The Intermediate Text and Description 2 would only be used for the sorting criteria composites Service/Quality and Waste Material/Quality . The value in the Service No . or Waste Material No. field is generated as Description 1 and the value of the Quality Code field as Description 2. Example: This would produce the following info line: Service 4711 Quality 1A: Note An info line cannot contain more than 50 characters. If the pre-text, post-text, and intermediate text creates a line above this limit, it will automatically be truncated to 50 characters. Therefore, the pre-text, post-text, and intermediate text should be kept as short as possible. Additional Texts One of the most important aspects of combine invoicing is the option to flexibly apply additional texts with the services rendered. The type and content of these additional texts can be individually defined by the users for each invoice layout. The invoices from a waste disposal company require that a lot of additional information about the services rendered normally be included (e.g. weighbridge ticket no., movement form no., etc.). The variety and variability of this additional information means that it is often impossible to display it in the form of individual columns, as we would other invoice information like the quantity, unit, price and amount. This would require that the invoice be generated in the impractical landscape format and the information content would still be too little. This is why enwis offers the option to insert this additional information for combine invoices as text lines attached to service lines, i.e. as a kind of extended service description. Basically, all additional texts for a service line are inserted as automatically generated invoice lines of the Text type and linked to the associated service line via the Attached to Line No. field. By doing so, if the service line is deleted on the combine invoice document, the associated additional texts are automatically deleted, as well. Go to Navigate Texts Additional Texts Combine Invoice from the invoice layout card to define the additional texts to be generated; they are a central element of the invoice layout specifications. Additional texts can also be defined for rental invoices and quantity consolidation. A line of additional information is always associated with a certain service line. First go to the Position field to define where the additional information about the service line should appear on the invoice. The following options are available: Option Description Before invoice line text The additional text will be inserted before the invoice line and before the info lines already associated with the service line using the Attached to Line No. field and will have its own line number which is lower than that of the service line. These are usually lines that have been assigned to the service line using the Assign Text Before function. Before invoice line The additional text will be inserted before the invoice line but after the info lines which have already been given a line number lower than the service line using the Attach to Line No** .** field. After invoice line text The additional text will be inserted after the invoice line and also after the info lines that have been associated with the service line using the Attach to Line No. field and have been given a line number higher than the service line. This option is the default setting. After invoice line text The additional text will be inserted after the invoice line and also after the info lines that have been associated with the service line using the Attach to Line No. field and have been given a line number higher than the service line. This option is the default setting. After invoice line The additional text will be inserted after the invoice line but before the info lines that have been associated with the service line using the Attach to Line No. field and have been given a line number higher than the service line. These are usually lines that have been assigned to the service line as automatic text components using the Assign Text After function. The options above basically apply individually to each invoice layout specification line. In other words, the placement of each additional text line controlled by a specification line can be defined individually. Certain texts can be inserted before the invoice line and others after. This provides flexibility in designing invoices. Basically, all specification lines in the invoice layout are processed in the order shown. First, the definitions of the first line (normally line no. 10,000) are processed and inserted, then the second line, etc. For the sake of clarity, we recommend setting up the specification lines in the order they will be processed: Before invoice line text Before invoice line After invoice line text After invoice line Additional information on the fields, dimensions, and material catalogs, as well as direct info lines, can be stored in the invoice layout specifications. In addition, several lines can be associated with the same field and the various information can be inserted at different places in the invoice. Use the Type, Field No. and Dimension Code fields to define the association between the specification line and the generated additional text lines. The following options are available for the Type field: Option Description Field The additional text is associated with a field in the waste management line defined in the Field No. field. Use Lookup to show all of the available fields. The name of the selected field is automatically shown in the Name field. Field The additional text is associated with a field in the waste management line defined in the Field No. field. Use Lookup to show all of the available fields. The name of the selected field is automatically shown in the Name field. Dimension The additional text is associated with a dimension connected with the waste management line. The dimension code of the document line to be used is defined in the Dimension Code field. The name of that dimension will be transferred to the Name field in the invoice layout specification line. Material catalog The additional text is associated with a material catalog connected to the waste management line. The material catalog of the document line to be used is defined in the Dimension Code field. The name of that material catalog will be transferred to the Name field in the invoice layout specification line. Text A complete line of stored text will be inserted. To assign the info line to the specification line, go to Link Action Text . Separate texts can be stored for different languages and sites."

The current accounting is shown via these posting groups. This means that the receivables accounts, the cash discount accounts, the billing and compensation accounts, the interest and charge accounts are consigned in a differentiated way for different groups of customers and vendors. A posting group must be allocated to each customer or vendor via the customer or vendor card so that invoices and credit memos can be entered correctly. A customer and vendor posting group can also be consigned in the invoice layout. The posting groups from the invoice layout established for the customer or vendor override the values consigned in the customer or vendor card. Counting forms can be allocated to customers and vendors. These are used in order to determine how an invoice is paid (e.g. transfer, cash,..). The payment forms can be consigned on the customer or vendor card on the register payments . A payment form can also be consigned in the invoice layout. The payment form from the invoice layout established for the customer or vendor overrides the value consigned in the customer or vendor card. In the field Rental Invoice Layout Code an invoice layout for the rental invoice can be consigned. This invoice layout is transferred into the rental value entry on order clearance and taken into account within the framework of the rental invoice. It is possible to consign the sorting information for the combine invoice and rental invoice in the specifications Layout Code. This specifications layout can be allocated to the \"general\" invoice layouts. The advantage is that the sorting information only needs to be consigned once and assigned to the corresponding invoice layouts. If the field Add. Texts from Spec. Layout has no tick, the additional texts from the specifications layout are taken into account in the combine invoice, rental invoice and quantity consolidation. In the field Prefix Info Sub-Sorting a prefix (e.g. dash) can be defined which is then placed in front of an info line of the sub sorting used as a header. Register Combine Invoice In the option field New Invoice per on the invoice layout card a selection must be made between the options \"Business-with No.\" and \"Invoice-with No.\". Both options are identical to the fields of the same name on the order line via which the invoice recipient is defined. This is usually the service recipient, for which the order was created and under which number the entry was made. As a rule both fields therefore have the same content. Another customer can be declared as invoice recipient on the order line in the field Invoice-with No. In this case the option invoice layout New Invoice per = Invoice-with No would sensibly be selected for the invoice layout. If the field New Invoice per has the option Invoice-with No. selected, there is the possibility of additionally placing a tick in the field Sort. by Business-with No.. The orders on the combine invoices are then sorted automatically following the posting with number. The sorting of the combine invoices is controlled in the option fields Invoice Sorting by (1) – (6) . Here the criterion must be indicated according to which the combine invoice is to compile the individual entries. If the option \"Blank\" is selected, the order entries are arranged in the order in which they are located in the system, meaning in the order of the order entry, thus sorted according to order numbers and line numbers. One thing which is significantly more useful and in line with the actual function of the invoice layout is however one of the numerous options offered for selection for sensible compilation of the invoice entries in terms of content. Only the most important of these are named here: Task site Order Type Code Project No. Service No. Quality Code In total there are more than 20 different functions available in the field Invoice Sorting by . In the option fields Break on Sort Change (1) – (6) it is determined how enwis should behave if it meets a new sorting criterion. An example of a change of type would be the change from the Rathausstraße customer task site to the Hauptstraße customer task site if the customer task sites were specified as a criterion for the invoice sorting. If the field Info on Sort Change (1) – (6) also has the option \"Full Text\" selected, the complete address is added to the customer task sites. For the option \"Full Text\" a multi-line information text is issued. This option is not available for all sorting criteria. If it is not available, it is replaced automatically by the option \"Info Line\". The option \"Full Text\" is available for the following sorting criteria and it has the effects described below: Sorting criterion Issue Bal. Acc. No. Complete address of the customer/vendor of the counter entry Bal. Acc. Site Complete address of the customer/vendor task site of the counter entry task site Complete address of the customer/vendor task site Service/Quality Description of a service quality specially applied for this combination from service and quality where appropriate. Tour Description of the tour Tour plan Description of the tour plan If the field Info on Sort Change (1) – (6) has the option \"Info Line\" selected, the system inserts an empty line and an information line. The sorting criterion is written into the info line in our example of the code of the customer task site. All associated invoice entries follow under these info lines. If the field Break on Sort Change has the option \"New Invoice\" set, a new invoice or credit memo is applied for each type change. Note The selection of the combination Invoice Sorting by = Document No. and Break on Sort Change = New Invoice can also be created within the combine invoice single invoices or credit memos. In contrast to the direct invoice of individual documents, the rules for automatic insertion of additional information which are consigned in the invoice layout code are however accessed so that the invoice can be formed more transparently, more meaningfully and more flexibly. The option \"Pagebreak\" in the field Break on Sort Change triggers a page break for each change of the sorting criterion. A prerequisite for this option is that a sorting criterion must be determined. This option is only valid if the field Zäsur bei Sortenwechsel does not have the option \"New Invoice\" as a new document is generated in this case on changing the sorting criterion which implies the start of a new printed page. Note The field Break on Sort Change (1) – (6) makes sorting into six downstream levels possible. This means that after sorting according to e.g. customer task sites has taken place, the service and invoice entries which are thus assigned to a customer task site can then once again be sorted according to all criteria which are available on the first level (e.g: Document No., Contract No., Job No.) etc. Via the field Info on Sort Change it is also possible to search for the options Infozeile or Volltext once again, through which the corresponding texts are inserted for a type change of the second or third order... as well. It is however not possible to trigger a new invoice or a page break through the type change on these downstream sorting levels.** Register Rental Invoice In the register rental Invoice of the invoice layout card it is possible to make settings for the rental invoice by combine invoice: In the field Report Type Rental Invoice a special code for the rental invoice can be consigned. This means that a report can be selected via this field which defines the graphic design of the invoice creation for this customer. In contrast to the settings in the register Combine Invoice of the invoice layout card sortings of the first and second order can be made for the rental invoice. This sorting is defined via the option fields On Rental Inv. Sort Change and Rental Invoice Sub-Sorting by . The following criteria can be selected: Customer Task Site Order Type Code Document No. Contract No. Job. No. Ex. Doc. No Rental No. Via the field On Rental Inv. Sort. Change it is possible to set whether a new invoice is to be created or an info line inserted for a type change. A tick in the field Info. Line on R. Inv. Sub-Sort. ensures that the second sorting level is generated on a type change. This means that the rental invoice can be controlled through the invoice layout completely analogous to the \"normal\" order statement even if a somewhat limited number of options is offered in comparison. Unlike the \"normal\" invoice layout the rental time period can also be issued in an additional info line in the rental invoice. A tick must be placed in the field Show Rental Period for this purpose. The field Invoice Transfer into can be used to control whether completed order lines _(_Invoice Transfer into = completed orders) or direct unposted invoices (Invoice Transfer into = unposted invoices) are to be created by the combine invoice first of all. Unlike in the \"normal\" order creation and statement there are first of all no direct rental relevant order lines in enwis. In the rental transaction orders only trigger the provision, exchange, emptying and collection of equipment. The number and type of equipment, a service type, the data of the provision or collection and the customer are all located in rental orders or in the equipment entries of the order lines. Possible price forming criteria may be present but a direct price for the rental invoice does not have to be taken from the order. Significant information for the rental price calculation is missing which enwis takes from the order lines for the invoicing of other orders. The rental price calculation always and exclusively occurs via the rental invoice matrix. The invoice method and the rental price are calculated from this matrix and via the codes consigned there for the invoice sequence for the rental invoice. This information can be written in either completed order lines or invoices which have not been posted. Register Qty. Consolidation Via the field Automat. Textbaustein it is possible to insert the standard text component of this service into the invoice in addition to the service. Text components can be assigned to a service in two ways. a text component is assigned to the relevant service via the service card and the field Automatic Ext. Texts is ticked on the service card on the customer card a customer specific designation is allocated to the service via the link Navigate Service Description as an automatic text component. Here a tick must also be inserted into the field Automatic Ext. Texts if the consigned service description is to appear in invoices and credit memos by combine invoice. In the case of conflict the customer specific service description has priority in front of the general standard text component which is consigned on the service card. Register Display In the Feld Grad. Price Splitting the selection exists between the options: Multi line Single line Single line plus info If the following graduation with splitting is agreed with a customer for the pricing: 0 – 3 t = 15-, € 3 – 6 t = 12-, € 6 t = 10-, € the resultant invoice entry can be presented in one line with it remaining unclear to the invoice recipient how the price for e.g. 12 t is made up in concrete terms and the price per t is reduced in stages in this example from 15-,€ to 10-,€. If this is to be presented clearly for the customer, the multiple line presentation must be selected. For this multi-line presentation the billable service is however split up over several lines while the warehouse relevant waste management quantity remains linked to the first line. This presents a severe handicap for the cost accounting viewing of the order. If work with graduated volumes is to take place in the pricing policy and the orders are subsequently to be analysed by the controlling, the option \"single line plus info\" must be chosen. Here the complete invoice service remains on the first line on which the average price calculated is declared. In addition further text lines are generated under this service line which explain in the form of an informative text how the average price indicated has come about. The customer thus receives all the information about the pricing in detail without the invoice service being split up. The assignment of invoice and service quantity is thus possible without any difficulty. In the field Sub-Total Type it is possible to choose between the options \"Blank\" , \"Amount\", \"Quantity\" and \"Both\") . Subtotals can be formed for each primary sorting criterion. This means that if the criterion \"Customer task site\" is selected in the field Invoice Sorting by for example and a subtotal was determined, a subtotal is formed for each customer task site through the invoice layout and the report used for the combine invoice. On issue of the subtotals in the report a line with a descriptive text and the corresponding subtotal is generated in the field Quantity and/or Amount. It is possible that a subtotal for quantities is not printed although this was set by the user. Subtotals for quantities are only meaningful and calculated correctly if sorting occurs according to quantity relevant criteria and the unit code is not changed. Otherwise subtotals with a misleading content would be issued. enwis therefore checks whether the main sorting criterion is a service, an article or a waste material and whether all quantities refer to the same unit code. If this is not the case, no subtotal for the quantity is issued. Note As subtotals are established dynamically, this can only occur via reports which support this functionality. In enwis there are the following standard reports: 5030453 Waste Mgt. - Sales Invoice 5030454 Waste Mgt. - Sales Cr. Memo 5030475 Proforma Sales Invoice 5030476 Proforma Sales Credit Memo Individual reports must be adapted accordingly. In the field Invoice Copies it is possible to specify how many invoice copies are to be created on printing the invoice. The Exclude from Tour Multi-Report (do not print multi-tour report) does strictly speaking have nothing to do with the invoice layout. Multi-reports do in principle work on an order lines basis, meaning that documents can be created from the many lines of an order by using them. Here a new page is applied for each line and the customer indicated on the line is entered in the header of each page. The multi-report function enables the information in the order header to be ignored in a targeted way when creating documents and to be replaced by information from the line. The tour logic provides the possibility of printing order confirmations, shipment slips and other papers of all associated order lines across different orders. The tour logic made a batch functionality multi-report available: All reports for the whole tour are issued for all associated orders via a print command. Within the framework of this agreement there are nevertheless many customers for whom no reports are to be printed out although they do definitely have documents sent to them in different contexts. In order to enable this, the field do not print multi-report is available on the invoice layout card which can be ticked individually for each customer."

    "keywords": "Invoice Layout Matrix Overview Any number of invoice layouts can be saved in the system for each external account (customer and vendor). Document lines pertaining to the same external account, the same currency code and the same invoice layout code will be summarized and sorted into combine invoices. This function makes it easy for users to show, for example, sub-activities with a specific customer that should always be put into their own invoices, as well as a certain sorting or invoice design that differs from the other invoices for this customer. It is not necessary to assign one or multiple invoice layouts to each external account. The same invoice layout can be used for several external accounts (the invoices are automatically separated by the different customers and vendors. The invoice layout associated with a document line to be invoiced must be recognized before the combine invoice because the invoice layout code itself is a criterion for the combine invoice. How to assign an invoice layout code to an order line before the combine invoice will be explained in detail below: Invoice Layout Matrix General Information enwis has to know the invoice layout to be invoiced with before it begins the combine invoice, because the invoices to be generated are automatically separated by invoice layout code and, afterwards, a specific invoice layout can no longer be assigned to an external account. This is done on the order line by filling in the Invoice Layout Code field. The Invoice Layout Code field has to be filled in before the completed orders are created so that the subsequent combine invoice can refer to it. In general, there are four methods for doing this: Contract The person in charge can fill out the Invoice Layout Code field manually in the contract. In this case, the invoice layout code is automatically copied to the sales order when the order is created from the contract, and from there it is copied unchanged to the Completed Order . This is definitely a practical method for managing certain business cases what should be invoiced separately. Sales Order The person in charge can fill out or edit the Invoice Layout Code field manually in the sales order. This allows the invoice layout code to be copied over when the sales order is transferred into a completed order. Normally, this is only done in exceptional cases, because it would take too much effort to flag each order line with an invoice layout code manually. Release Function When sales orders are released, the invoice layout code is determined according to job-specific criteria saved in the Release Function under the Status tab in Waste Management Setup and copied from there to the document lines. This procedure is possible but not recommendable, because the system requires additional processing time to do so. The default procedures available should be more than adequate. Invoice Layout Matrix When the sales order is released, the invoice layout code is automatically determined using the invoice layout matrix and copied from there to the document lines. This method will be described in further detail below. Combined with the manual assignment of an invoice layout in the contract, this is surely the most efficient and, for users, easiest way to handle the many options for assigning invoice layouts. Matrix Setup The invoice layout matrix works similarly to the other known matrices in enwis, e.g. the rental invoice matrix. It determines an invoice layout code by finding the matrix entry that exactly matches the current business case. In doing so, it compares the order line to the invoice layout matrix. In the example above, the settings define that the invoice layout PAPER should be used when all of the following conditions apply: The order type is \"sales\". The sale will be invoiced to customer C00040. The material was purchased from vendor V00020. The business case was settled through the site LONDON. When the transaction is a sale but the other defined criteria in a line in the invoice layout matrix do not apply to this business case, then the STANDARD invoice layout will be used in this example. It is defined here as the lowest common denominator: all sales that meet other criteria than those defined. This example illustrates that new customers and vendors do not necessarily have to be assigned their own invoice layout. According to the setup of the invoice layout matrix described above, they will automatically be assigned the STANDARD invoice layout code. The following criteria can be applied to the invoice layout code in the invoice layout matrix: Invoice Layout Reference 1 Posting Type Post-with No. Task-at Code Invoice with No. Business Flow Bal. Account Posting Type Bal. Acc. Post-with No. Bal. Acc. Task-at Code Bal. Acc. Invoice-with No. Site Code The Invoice Layout Reference 1 field allows users to set additional criteria for determining the invoice layout. The following options are available: Invoice Layout Group Job Service Group Service Contract These additional criteria can be defined in Invoice Setup . The system can refer directly from the invoice layout matrix to the additional options defined in Invoice Setup using the Invoice Layout Reference 1 field. The invoice layout code is determined using the invoice layout matrix as soon as the sales order is released. Invoice layout codes are only determined for order lines that do not already have one, e.g. that was assigned manually via a contract or sales order. The manually assigned invoice code takes priority over automatic determination through the invoice layout matrix and the latter will not override the former. Note If the release of a completed order is reversed, the invoice layout will not be undone, nor will it be redefined when the order is released again. When a document is copied into another, the invoice layout code is never copied, too. Users can go from the invoice layout matrix to the invoice layout card of the current matrix line by clicking on the Layout icon. Invoice Layout Assignment via External Account General Information As described above, it is not generally necessary to assign an invoice layout to or create a new invoice layout for newly entered customers and vendors. Depending on the setup of the invoice layout matrix, this might already be taken care of by a default invoice layout. It is possible, however, to automate the explicit creation and/or assignment of an invoice layout when a new external account is entered. The default settings for this are defined in Invoice Setup under the Invoice Layout tab for customers and vendors. The values in the following fields are important: Inv. Layout New Customer Inv. Layout Cust. Prefix Inv. Layout New Vendor Inv. Layout Vend. Prefix We will describe the settings for customers, because the settings for vendors are identical. Option: Matrix When a new customer is entered, there are no automatic invoice layout procedures. The customer is assigned an invoice layout using the logic in the current invoice layout matrix if invoice layout codes for the overarching criteria (e.g. posting type Sales, but no information on a concrete customer) are saved there. Option: Set Matrix to Customer A new invoice layout matrix line will be inserted. First, the invoice layout code will be determined that would be copied for the new customer according to the current setup of the invoice layout matrix (i.e., a matrix line with cross-account criteria must be saved in the system). The criteria for this general matrix line might be defined as follows: Posting Type = Sales Invoice Layout Code = STANDARD This matrix line will now be copied, expanded and inserted as a direct reference to the new customer in the invoice layout matrix. The criteria in the new, additional matrix line are defined as follows: Posting Type = Sales Invoice with No. = No. of new customer Invoice Layout Code = STANDARD The effect up to this point is no different than selecting the Matrix option; in both cases, the customer is assigned the same invoice layout. However, assigning the invoice layout using the Set Matrix to Customer option is more direct. It might be easier to track at a later point in time and easier to change. In addition, the filtered assigned matrix can be viewed directly from the customer card by going to navigate Invoice Layout Invoice Layout Matrix , which is not possible when assigning the invoice layout indirectly using general criteria. Option: Copy Matrix to Customer The system will create a new invoice layout and insert a new invoice layout matrix line. The insertion logic for a new invoice layout matrix line is exactly the same as the \"Set Matrix to Customer\" option. However, the new line is not simply assigned to ascertained invoice layout code (in our example, STANDARD). Instead, the invoice layout is copied, inserted as a new invoice layout with the number of the external account, and assigned to the new matrix line. Example: A new customer is created with the customer no. 4711. The criteria in the general matrix line are defined as follows: Posting Type = Sales Invoice Layout Code = STANDARD The criteria in the newly entered matrix line are defined as follows: Posting Type = Sales Invoice with No. = 4711 Invoice Layout Code = 4711 The Code field (= primary key) of the new invoice layout can also be influenced by the Inv. Layout Cust. Prefix field. The Inv. Layout Cust. Prefix field is only available when the \"Copy Matrix to Customer\" option has been selected in the Inv. Layout New Customer field. Otherwise, the field is faded and cannot be edited. When the \"Copy Matrix to Customer\" option has been selected and a new customer is entered, a new invoice layout will also be generated and inserted into the invoice layout matrix. It will contain the following code (= invoice layout primary key): The value saved in the Inv. Layout Cust. Prefix field The new customer number (= customer primary key) Example: The new customer is no. 4711. If no value is saved in the Inv. Layout Cust. Prefix field, the code of the new invoice layout is also 4711. If a value is saved in the Inv. Layout Cust. Prefix field, e.g. \"D-\", the code of the new invoice layout is D-4711. This approach helps avoid potential numbering conflicts between automatically and manually setup invoice layouts and also means that the origin and probably assignment of an invoice layout is recognizable directly in its code."

    "title": "Customer-Vendor Changeover | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Customer-Vendor Changeover General The customer/vendor changeover of waste management order lines allows a flexible response to current fluctuations in the market price. This functionality is used particularly where materials fluctuate between recyclable material and waste, i.e. their storage is sometimes a customer waste management service and sometimes a vendor purchase (e.g. paper and scrap business). A customer waste management line thus turns into a vendor one or the opposite depending solely on the price development. Customer-vendor changeover does in principle only occur in orders, never in quotes and contracts. In invoices and credit memos which only have one customer or vendor, changeover is in principle not possible. The functions of the customer-vendor changeover are only available for services, not for articles. Set up The set ups which are necessary for working with the function customer-vendor chaneover are explained below. General set ups In order for the functionality of customer-vendor changeover to be used at all it is essential that a tick is placed in the Waste Management Setup in the field Allow Cust./Vend. Changeover on the register General . All customers/vendors and their task sites, which are involved in the customer-vendor changeover, must also be assigned to one another via the business partner card and the associated business partner sites. Automatic changeover on order clearance In order to trigger the customer-vendor changeover automatically on order clearance, in the Waste management setup the field Auto-Changeover on Release is ticked on the register Status . In the field Auto-Changeover on Status it is possible to make a setting so that the customer-vendor changeover and thus a new setting of price is to occur automatically as soon as a certain order status e.g. final control is reached. Dispatching, follow up entry and final control are available as possible options. Suppressing customer-vendor changeover automatically. The jumping can also in principle be suppressed depending on the order status. Via the option field Suppress Changeover until on the register Status of Waste management setup it is possible to consign that the jumping is suppressed up to a particular status of the order. Dispatching, follow up entry and final control are available as possible options. The background: If a customer suddenly becomes a vendor, this could confuse a case worker in the order processing or be disadvantageous for the dispatching. If the field Suppress Changeover until is set up to the option value \"Processing\" for example, then no jumping is in principle carried out in waste management orders with the status \"Creation\" or \"Dispatching\". The customer remains the customer even if the posting has to be converted to the posting type \"Purchase\". If both functions: Auto-changeover on Status processing suppress Changeover until processing are seen in a work flow, the following scenario would be conceivable. A customer/vendor changeover does in principle not occur for the order status for the option values \"Creation\" and \"Dispatching\". If the status of the waste management order is set to the status \"Processing\", the order for the subsequent work process appears for another case worker for the order follow up entry. Before the order becomes visible there, a new establishment of the price occurs and a few customer processes are already flipped into vendor processes (or the opposite) so that it is immediately possible to continue working with the correct posting type in the subsequent processing of the order. Suppressing customer-vendor changeover manually Customer-vendor changeover can be suppressed for each waste management line individually by ticking the field Business Flow Fixed in the order line. Lines in which the field is ticked do not changeover in principle. Through the customer-vendor changeover of a waste management line the field Business Flow Fixed is set automatically to YES in this line. Each waste management line can thus only change the posting type once automatically. This is in principle required as otherwise - depending on the design of the service catalog - it is not possible to prevent constant changeover from sales to purchase and the opposite and thus an endless loop is produced. Customer-vendor changeover The customer-vendor changeover is a function integrated into enwis which makes it possible to change a customer process into a vendor process and vice versa automatically on the basis of the pricing. The functionality can in principle be used in the following variants: Define Posting Type = Sales or Purchase Define Posting Type = Changeover on neg. Price Define Posting Type = Neg. Price = Purch. / Pos. Prices = Sales Define Posting Type = Neg. Price = Sales / Pos. Price = Purchase These variants can be used alternatively or in a complementary way but they cannot be used together in the same price line. The configuration of the relevant fields differs and the function and service scope of the variants are different even if the result may be the same for the users in many cases. Flow of business and posting type The posting type is changed through the changeover. In this way a sale becomes a purchase for example. Nevertheless, monitoring should sometimes take place to show that it originally involves a customer intended business transaction. This can have an effect on the pricing. The field Business Flow serves this purpose with the options \"Vendor Oriented\" and \"Customer Oriented\". The option value in the field Business Flow normally corresponds to the option value in the field Posting Type . This reference is reversed during customer/vendor changeover. This means: While the posting type \"Sales\" becomes \"Purchase\", the field Business Flow remains on the value \"Customer Oriented\". This has the following advantages: the nature of the business remains transparent it is possible via the price group matrix that another price group code is operated in the combine invoice it becomes possible to generate separate invoices to the same vendor for example, depending whether vendor services are involved which come from \"normal\" business or converted business within the framework of the customer vendor jumping Set entry type = sale or purchase In one example the customer-vendor changeover is explained via the function Define Posting Type Salse or Purchase A customer process finds a price line in which the field Define Posting Type is on the option value \"Purchase\". The jumping is first of all triggered by the current difference between the posting type of the order line (=sale) and the value in the field Define Posting Type . Set up: It is possible to branch off into the price group matrix of the selected customer in the customer card via the link Home/Process/ price group matrix . In the price group matrix a new line is applied as can be seen in the next image. In the next stage you branch off into the vendor which is consigned to the customer. The price group matrix of the selected vendor is called up from the vendor card via the link home/Process/Price Group Matrix . In the price group matrix a new line is applied as can be seen in the next image. In addition service price lines must be defined with an empty posting type. In the field Define Posting Type it is possible to post whether a customer price (option value = \"Sales\" or a vendor price (option value = \"Purchase\") is involved. If the corresponding service price line is now operated in an order line, enwis compares whether the posting type of the order line matches the posting type of the service order line in the field Define Posting Type . If this is not the case, the posting type of the order line is changed and the customer or vendor entered into the field Post-with No. via the business partner card is validated instead of the customer/vendor of the order line. The customer/vendor task site can also changeover, meaning that the value in the field Task-at Code is automatically validated. Example: A waste management order is created from a contract CONTR000006 with the customer D00340 and the customer task site E00000082 via the service \"10-100107110101 A19\". The waste management line is shown in the image below: Following completed feedback the order is cleared and it becomes a completed order. The function customer-vendor changeover is triggered by the order clearance. enwis has compared the posting type of the waste management line (sale) with the same one of the operated service price line and established that these do not match. The posting type of the waste management line is thus switched to the value \"Purchase\". Instead of the customer D00340 the vendor K00940 linked via the business partner logic was entered. The customer task site E00000082 of the customer is also switched automatically to the vendor task site B0000078 via business partner logic. Define Posting Type = Changeover on neg. Price The function changeover on neg. price is realised via another logic in order to implement customer-vendor jumping for a negative price. The following settings are required on the service price line: If this service price line is found in a customer process in the above example, then the customer/vendor changeover would only be triggered if the price consigned in the price line is negative. If the price is positive, changeover does not take place. If the price is negative, then the posting type of the order line is changed from sale to purchase (or the opposite). Nevertheless no pricing is triggered and the price found in the price line is used as an absolute value. An advantage of this method is that the price maintenance is clear. An additional advantage is that this method can also be used to flexibly achieve a customer/vendor jump which is via a reference price group in connection with pricing. Example: A waste management order is created from a contract with the customer D00340 and the customer task site E00000082 via the service \"10-100107110101 A19\". The waste management line is shown in the image below: Following completed feedback the order is cleared and it becomes a completed order. The function customer-vendor changeover is triggered by the order clearance. enwis has operated the corresponding service price line and established that the price consigned is negative and the field Define Posting Type is set to the option value \"Changeover neg. Price\". The customer waste management line was thus converted into a vendor waste management line and the price was transferred into the waste management line with its absolute value (+120). If this order is invoiced later on, then enwis creates a corresponding purchase invoice. The price is thus established from the same price line which triggers the jumping and then logically has the opposite sign in the opposite posting type. Note Through the customer-vendor changeover of a waste management line the field Business Flow Fixed is set automatically to JA in this line. Each waste management line can thus only change the posting type once automatically. This is in principle required as otherwise - depending on the design of the service catalog - it is not possible to prevent constant jumping from sales to purchase and the opposite and thus an endless loop is produced. Define Posting Type = Neg. Price = Purchase/Pos. Price = sale The functions Neg. Price = Purchase/Pos. Price = Sale or Neg. Price = Sale/Pos. Price = purchase makes the customer-vendor jump possible on the basis of simple logic. In this way the direction of business (customer or vendor) is determined by the sign of the service price. The following settings are required on the service price line: For the service \"10-100107110101 A19\" a service price line with a negative service price (-100,- €) is applied. The field Define Posting Type is set to the option value \"Neg. Price = Purchase/Pos. Price = Sale\" If this service price line is operated from a customer order line, then this is validated in a vendor order line (Neg. Price = Purchase). Example: A waste management order is created from a contract with the customer D00340 and the customer task site E00000082via the service \"10-100107110101 A19\". The waste management line is shown in the image below: Following completed feedback the order is cleared and it becomes a completed order. The function Customer-Vendor changeover is triggered by the order clearance. enwis made a vendor order line from this customer order line and correctly entered the price with its absolute value (100,-€). If this order is invoiced later on, then enwis creates a corresponding purchase invoice. Note In this variant of the customer-vendor jumping, the field Business Flow Fixed is not set to \"Yes\". This means that the possibility for repeated changeover remains if this is required for the course of business."

    "keywords": "Handling Errors in Invoice Types and Invoice Batches General Information When the order releases, rental invoices, and combine invoices and the posting of unposted documents is initiated through an invoice type or invoice batch, errors which occur in the posting routines per the default setting are intercepted and saved in the log ledger entries of the invoice type. This allows the routine to continue posting other documents despite the error in posting one document, if the users have established the default setting in that invoice type accordingly. Handling Errors Alternatively, when the Break On Error box is checked, the invoice type or invoice batch will behave the same as in a manually initiated posting routine. In this case, the batch processing will not continue but will be interrupted when the same error message appears that the users would receive from the document when posting using the F9 key. Example: We assume that the RELEASE invoice type card will execute the release of two orders 1325 and 1326. The following error occurs for order 1326: Customer No. 1000113 ist blocked. If the Break On Error box is checked in the invoice type, then the processing is immediately interrupted when the error occurs with the same error message that enwis would send were the invoice manually initiated from a document: In this case, no invoice log ledger entry will be made. In addition, no other subsequent posting routines with the same invoice type will be executed. enwis completely interrupts the processing when this error message is sent. If the Break On Error box is not checked, then the batch processing continues to the end. The following message will be issued to indicate that a problem occurred in the processing of at least one of the documents with that invoice type. This message is displayed if the Show Statistics box under the General tab for that invoice type is checked. There is also a message in the corresponding invoice log showing that there was a problem executing the invoice type. Invoice Batches The Break On Error field offers the same function for invoice batches. The two functions are completely separate, however, which means: The setting in the invoice type refers exclusively to how enwis handles the execution of individual documents of that invoice type and has no influence on how it handles the execution of this invoice type within an invoice batch. This function is defined separately for the invoice batch and there it defines how the program will treat all invoice types executed within that batch. Other Setup Options The invoice group code that users are assigned to will determine whether they have the authority to change the Break On Error field setting in a given invoice type or invoice batch. The parameters are defined on the invoice group card regarding which members have the independent authority to change this invoice group code. If the Break On Error box is checked under the General tab, then the users may change this setting in the invoice type and invoice batch; otherwise, they must work with the given default setting. In the example below, users assigned to the PRIV. CUST. invoice group may not edit the Break On Error field. This field cannot be edited in the invoice type or invoice batch. There is an additional setting option which refers to internal invoice batch functions. Routines can be called up for orders and completed orders by pressing the F9 Posting Functions key to initiate an internal invoice batch. In the background, the same functions are triggered as would be initiated by calling up an invoice type filtered to only include the current order. Any errors here will also be intercepted and saved in a log as though the combine invoice had been manually initiated using an invoice type that actually exists. However, the users still have the option in this case to set whether this internal batch routine should operate with error suppression or immediate error messages. This is accomplished by checking the Break on Batch Invoice Error box under the Combine Invoice tab in the Invoice Setup ."

Invoice logs A unique invoice log number is generated for each batch run. For that to happen, a number series has to be stored in the Invoice Log Numbers field as part of the Invoice Setup under the Numbering tab. Invoice logs can be pre-filtered and called up on each invoice type and invoice batch. They can also be called up by clicking on: enwis Invoicing/Combine Invoicing/Invoice Logs/Invoice Logs enwis Invoicing/History/Logs/Invoice Logs The individual invoice log number used to generate an unposted and posted document will be copied back into the document. This makes it easy to trace which documents were created during which batch invoice run. The users have an overview of which documents are \"theirs\". They have the option, e.g., to review all of the unposted invoices or credit memos they generated and print all of the invoices and credit memos they posted (and only these).

    "title": "Invoice Quantity Consolidation | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Invoice Quantity Consolidation General Information In enwis it is possible to consolidate quantities for invoicing quite easily and individually. In principle, customers and vendors can be processed in the same combine invoice for the same service with some quantities consolidated and some not. Conditions Before consolidating invoice quantities, the Allow Qty. Consol. box must be checked in Invoice Setup under the Combine Invoice tab. When no invoice quantity consolidation should take place at all, do not check this box as it will allow combine invoicing to run more quickly. Furthermore, the Qty. Consolidation box in the contract lines and order lines must be checked so that the invoice quantities can be consolidated. By default, the Qty. Consolidation box is not checked, but it can be checked in the contract, which will automatically be copied to the sales order. It is also possible to wait and first check this box in the sales order. Each order line to be invoiced can be set individually using the Qty. Consolidation field. For example, individual deliveries whose quantities would normally be consolidated in the invoice can be excepted from quantity consolidation by unchecking the box. The quantities of order lines will only be consolidated if the following values are the same: Service No. Unit of Measure Code Delivery Code Price Line Discount Invoice A combine invoice created from the sales order listed above would contain the following four invoice lines: Order lines 1 and 3 Order lines 2 and 4 same service as in order lines 1 and 3, but a different price and no delivery code Order line 5 no quantity consolidation Order line 6 no quantity consolidation The logic shown in this example of a single sales order is the same as if the unposted invoice lines from several sales orders were combined. Note No associated text lines from the sales order can be copied to the combine invoice for lines with quantity consolidation. Other Sorting Functions Invoice quantity consolidation in enwis also takes sorting codes set for a customer or vendor into account. For example, if a customer is invoiced separately by job, then quantity consolidation would also be separated by job, so that individual invoice lines with quantity consolidation would be output for each job. The sorting criteria can be set in the invoice layout. A combine invoice created from the sales order listed above would contain the following four invoice lines: Order lines 1 and 2 Order lines 3 and 4 same service as in order lines 1 and 2, but belonging to a different job and a different delivery type Order lines 5 and 6 same service and same job as in order lines 1 and 2, but different delivery code Quantity Consolidation Entries In terms of content, every invoice line with quantity consolidation consists of multiple order lines from completed orders. These individual order lines are saved as quantity consolidation entries for each invoice line with quantity consolidation in a combine invoice. The quantity consolidation entries can be viewed for the invoice lines individually by going to Actions (Alt+F10) Line Quantity Consolidation Entries or for the entire invoice by going to Navigate entries Quantity Consolidation Entries . The illustration below shows the quantity consolidation entries for the first invoice line. The relationship to the original document is maintained. The quantity consolidation entries function in a way that allows combine invoices containing invoice lines with quantity consolidation to also be canceled again, reversed to completed orders, and then recreated. Each quantity consolidation entry is still present in the completed orders as an independent order line where it is flagged as invoiced. When a combine invoice is deleted in whole or in part and reversed, then the Invoiced box in each completed order line associated with the invoice lines with quantity consolidation through the quantity consolidation entries will be automatically unchecked. In the following example, the second invoice line in the combine invoice with quantity consolidation is deleted. In the original document 1335, the Invoiced box in lines 50000 and 60000 is unchecked. The completed order lines 50000 and 60000 are now available again for a new invoicing run."

    "keywords": "Invoice Types and Invoice Batches General Information A number of functions have been bundled under invoice types and invoice batch that greatly simplify the options for invoice management. Among them are the following functions: Filters for order releases, rental invoices and combine invoices can be defined and saved as an invoice type. Invoicing can be initiate from the invoice type card. Any number of invoice types can be consolidated into one invoice batch. Releases, rental invoices and combine invoices can be consolidated into one invoice batch. Each invoice type in the invoice batch will be processed one after another. Invoicing can be initiated directly from the invoice batch. The invoicing procedure will be saved in an invoice log and the associated log ledger entries. Errors which arise during batch processing are also documented in log ledger entries. Invoice Types Invoice types can be called up by going to enwis Invoicing/Selection by Department/Combine Invoicing/Invoice Batch/Invoice Types . Using the invoice types, any number of different invoice filters can be defined and permanently saved. Under the General tab you can set the main invoice options that will otherwise have to be set for each individual invoice under the Options tab in Batch Processing Combine Invoicing. The value stored in the Invoice Type field indicates whether the invoice type means that a combine invoice an equipment invoice a release (i.e. order release) should be executed. Important date fields (e.g. invoice date ) can be fixed and stored in the system or controlled by the posting formulas (e.g. invoice date formula). Note If both fields hold values, the fixed date stored in the system has priority over the posting formula. The date formula is always associated with the current work date. If 2/12/2012 is set as the work date and the invoice date formula is set as \"-CM-1D\", then 30/11/2012 would be used as the invoice date. If this invoice type were initiated in the following month, e.g. on 4/1/2013, then 31/12/2012 would be used as the invoice date, assuming the same invoice date formula. The same logic applies to the document date, the task date, and the rental document task date. Users can store detailed filter definitions for the combine invoice and the rental invoice under the Combine Invoice Filter and Rental Invoice Filter tabs. Combine invoice filter example: In the example above, a combine invoice will be created for all completed customer orders (= posting type Sales) for the DORTMUND site if the Invoice Layout Code field indicates STANDARD and the Task Date was in the previous month (= Task Date Formula). Detailed filters for the order release can be defined under the Release Filter tab. Release filter example: In the example above, all customer orders (= posting type Sales) for the DORTMUND site will be released if the Status field indicates Final Inspection and the Task Date was in the previous month. By going to Home Process Function Invoices or pressing the F9 key, the defined order releases, rental invoices, and combine invoices can be initiated and executed directly from the invoice type card. All of these actions executed for the invoice type will be saved in an invoice log and can be viewed as log ledger entries (Navigate Invoice Type Log Ledger Entries). See the documentation on invoice logs for more information. Invoice Batch Invoice types present the opportunity to save invoice definitions. By using an invoice batch, users can combine as many invoice types into one batch as they wish. If the invoices are created using an invoice batch, then all invoice types will be processed in the order in which the user has selected them. The entire posting process can be illustrated using an invoice batch: Step 1: Order release (operational orders become completed orders) Step 2: Rental invoices (create completed rental orders) Step 3: Combine invoicing (combine invoice of completed orders and completed rental orders) Step 4: Posting combine invoice documents The steps are automatically executed one after another without the users having to do anything in between. Note If an invoice batch includes a command to generate a rental invoice with complete orders and then incorporate this into a combine invoice, then the following steps must be taken. First of all, an invoice batch line is needed with the invoice type \"Equipment Invoice\". This invoice type might set a limit for the task date (posting date of the rental value entry), for example. This invoice batch line creates the completed orders from the rental invoice. Next, an invoice batch line is needed with the invoice type \"Combine Invoicing\". In this invoice type, the Rental Invoice Document Line field (under the Combine Invoice Filter tab) should indicate the option \"YES\". This will ensure that the completed orders (= the generated rental lines) are incorporated into the combine invoice. If there are any order release errors, i.e. certain orders cannot be released, then the following steps will not be executed. Each line in an invoice batch will basically either be entirely processed or not at all. If an error occurs in one line of an invoice batch, then that entire invoicing step will be left unfinished. However, invoice steps that have already been successfully completed will not be influenced or undone by an error in a subsequent step. What enwis should do with an invoice step when an error occurs is defined in the Always Execute field under the General tab for the invoice type to which that invoice batch line is assigned. When an error occurs in an invoice step, that invoice step will only be executed if the Always Execute box is checked (indicating YES) for the invoice type to which the invoice batch is assigned. If an error occurs in combine invoicing, i.e. certain completed orders cannot be incorporated into the combine invoice, then users can decide in advance whether the correctly generated invoices should none the less be posted or not. Users can set whether and how automatic posting should occur in the Automatic Posting field under the Posting tab. The following options are available: Never Items are never automatically posted When No Errors Items are only automatically posted when no errors have occurred during the batch processing Always Correctly generated invoices are posted even if there are potential errors With regard to the automatic posting of generated combine documents from the invoice batch or invoice type, users can set whether only the current invoice log or the entire combine invoice should be posted in the Posting Range field under the Posting tab. By going to Home Process Function Run invoice Batch or pressing the F9 key, the order releases, rental invoices, and combine invoices defined in the invoice batch lines can be initiated and executed. All of the actions executed for this invoice batch will be saved in an invoice log and can be viewed in log ledger entries. See the documentation on invoice logs for more information."

    "keywords": "Invoicing Overview General Information Users of enwis have the option of invoicing sales orders directly or through batch processing. Below is an overview of the invoicing process. Setting Up a Number Series Before invoicing, it is necessary to save all the necessary number series (e.g. for unposted and posted invoices) in the Document No. Series Matrix. To find the document number series matrix, go to enwis Invoicing Administration Setup Document No. Series Matrix Invoice Layout Invoice layouts are the central interface for compiling, creating and designing combine invoices and for some of the related operations. The control mechanisms available through the invoice layout mainly affect the: Creation and sorting of combine invoices and rental invoices Type of sorting information for combine invoices and rental invoices Type, scope and order of additional texts for combine invoices and rental invoices Type, scope and order of additional texts for quantity consolidation Special pre-texts and post-texts for invoices There must be an invoice layout code in the lines of completed orders so that they can be invoiced. Without an invoice layout code, combine invoicing is not possible. Release and Completed Orders Service orders are converted into completed orders by releasing them. To find completed orders, go to Invoicing Completed Orders . Completed orders offer uses the opportunity to visually inspect and print out sales orders or invoice them directly before the combine invoicing step. Users can convert completed orders back into sales orders that can be edited by using Withdraw Release and Withdraw Release and Show functions, provided that there are no unposted documents related to these completed orders. After undoing the release, the sales orders are again available for processing in the operational order menus Waste Producer Processes and Waste disposal Processes. Every completed order line with its Invoice box checked will be invoiced. If the Invoice box is not checked, this order line will not be included in the combine invoicing process. During combine invoicing, completed orders will be transferred into sales invoices, sales credit notes, purchasing invoices and purchasing credit notes. The system decides automatically whether to create an invoice or a credit note depending on whether the total amount for services to be invoiced to a customer or vendor is positive or negative. Completed orders can be deleted after posting an invoice or credit note. This will depend on the setting of the Del. Compl. Orders on Posting field under the General tab in Invoice Setup . If this box is checked, the completed orders will be deleted after posting the invoice or credit note; otherwise, they will remain in enwis. Combine Invoicing To find batch processing for combine invoices, go to enwis Invoicing Combine Invoicing . The posting and document date for the invoices and credit notes can be set under the Options tab. All available fields for the waste management line can be filtered under the Completed Orders tab. In the example above, all completed orders for customers where the invoice layout was set to STANDARD and that were created in the period between 10/1/2013 and 10/31/2013 were invoiced and made ready for combine invoicing. Users can also add combine invoicing filters using Add filter under the Completed Orders tab. Unposted Invoices and Credit Notes The generated combine invoices and credit notes are available as unposted documents in Invoicing . All of the pricing and editing logic within enwis is available in the unposted documents, so users can continue to edit these invoices and credit notes. For example, they can still change or delete services. Individual lines in an unposted combine invoice or credit note can be deleted, in which case they are again available in the completed orders for the next combine invoice. If an unposted combine document is completely deleted, the corresponding completed orders will again be released for invoicing. This release can be undone within the completed orders, so that the sales orders are again available in the Waste Producer Processes and Waste disposal Processes menus. Posted Invoices and Credit Notes Invoices and credit notes have to be archived after posting; otherwise, they cannot be reversed at a later time. To make sure this happens, check the Archive Invoice and Archive Credit Note boxes under the Archive tab in Waste Management Setup . enwis offers all of the standard reversal and clearance options of Business Central for invoicing in respect to values. When a sales or purchasing credit note is posted, it can be offset in a posted standard invoice. In addition, customer and vendor ledger entries can be flagged with an \"Applies-to ID\" and the credit note will automatically be applied to these entries when it is posted. The posted invoices and credit notes shown in the Invoicing menu are the final documents that were posted directly from the unposted combine documents to the default general ledger. Only posted documents created by enwis will be visible here."

Invoice layout tab Click on the Invoice layout tab to adjust the following settings: Inv. Layout New Customer The following options are available for this field: Matrix: There are no automatic invoice layout settings when entering a customer. The customer is assigned an invoice layout using the logic of the current invoice layout matrix if common criteria have been stored in the system for this invoice layout code (e.g. Posting Type - Sales, but no information on a concrete customer). <!-- --> Set matrix to customer A new invoice layout matrix line is inserted. The system will initially determine the invoice layout code drawn on for the new customer based on the current setup of the invoice layout matrix (i.e., a matrix line with cross-account criteria must be stored in the system). The criteria for this general matrix line are then defined as follows: Posting Type = Sales Invoice Layout Code = STANDARD (e.g.) This matrix line will then be copied, added, and inserted as a direct reference to the new customer. The criteria in the new, additional matrix line is then defined as follows: Posting Type = Sales Inv. with No. = [no. of new customer] Invoice Layout Code = STANDARD The effect up to this point is no different than when selecting the Matrix option – in both cases, the customer is assigned the same invoice layout. The assignment is done more directly in the \"Set Matrix to Customer\" option, however. It may be easier to trace at a later stage and easier to change. In addition, the assigned matrix from the customer card can be pre-filtered and viewed directly by clicking on the Associated Information Sales Invoice Layout Invoice Layout Matrix link, which is not the case when assigned indirectly using general criteria. Copy matrix to customer: This will create a new invoice layout and insert a new invoice layout matrix line. The logic used for inserting a new invoice layout matrix line is constructed exactly the same as for the Set Matrix to Customer option. However, the new line is not simply assigned to the invoice layout code created (in our STANDARD example). Instead, the system copies the invoice layout and inserts it as a new invoice layout with the number of the new account as the code and assigns it to the new matrix line. Example: A new customer is generated with the No. 4711. The criteria in the general matrix line are defined as follows: Posting Type = Sales Invoice Layout Code = STANDARD (e.g.) The criteria in the newly entered matrix line are defined as follows: Posting Type = Sales Inv. with No. = 4711 Invoice Layout Code = 4711 In addition, the system generates a new invoice layout with the Code 4711.

    "title": "Minimum Invoice Value | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Minimum Invoice Value General Information The logic of the minimum invoice value allows users to suppress the creation of unposted documents via combine invoicing if the documents to be created do not meet or exceed the defined invoice value. The minimum invoice value is saved in the LCY Code. When the invoice or credit note is created in a foreign currency, the invoice amount will be converted into the LCY first for the purpose of comparison. Minimum invoice values can be saved for each customer, vendor, and document type (invoice or credit note). The creation of an unposted invoice or credit note can be suppressed depending on the gross value of the document. The definition of the minimum invoice value can also be linked to the balance account post-with number. However, this logic will only be followed if the underlying invoice layout has been set up to sort the invoice by balance account and to create a new invoice when the sorting changes. Setup In order to use the minimum invoice value logic, the Allow Minimum Invoice Values box under the General tab in Invoice Setup must be checked. If it is not, then the minimum invoice values will be ignored, even if the information mentioned above has been saved. This setup has two benefits: The principle management of minimum invoice values can be handled centrally. Users who do not want to use the minimum invoice value logic can reduce the extra processing time needed to calculate the minimum invoice values. The actual minimum invoice value for each invoice layout can be saved by going to Actions Function Minimum Invoice Value . In the example below, a minimum invoice value of EUR 100.00 has been saved for customer invoices in the STANDARD invoice layout. Invoices When users run a combine invoice and some unposted documents are not created due to minimum invoice values, a message will appear informing the users of the number and type of these documents not created. This also applies if the invoices are generated through invoice types or invoice batches. Whether to consider minimum invoice values can be set individually for each invoice run. This is determined using the Ignore Minimum Invoice Value box under the Options tab in Combine Invoicing . When this box is checked, the minimum invoice value will not be considered in the current invoice run, even if one has been saved. This allows users to invoice older sales orders that never reached the minimum value, even though no new services have been rendered for that customer."

    "keywords": "Operational journal events Events The operational journal is fundamentally based on events. These can be defined individually and they thus display process related operational sequences. These process related operational sequences can have both a link to the waste management relevant processes and also to each desired process which is logged and documented via events. A necessity emerges from this process related display to log the operational journal relevant data in the form that only processes which also belong together in terms of content are logged. For an order this would mean that only the order lines which depict a business transaction are generated within an order. This means that several different business partners could be logged in an order. They must however belong to the same business transaction. Example: An order which depicts a customer waste management where the transport is carried out by a vendor subcontractor would be an example of this. As both these processes do however belong to a business transaction, this process can continue to be shown in an order. The order project number thus shows the bracket which connects the individual processes with one another. The references for the process are shown on the register General of the events card. In the example above returns are involved (field Event Group ), with a delivery involved which contained foreign matter. The delivery itself took place on 31.10.2013 (field Event Date ). The logging of this event took place on the same day (field Document Date . The delivery took place in the Silver Location (field Location Code ) and the person responsible was the yard administrator with the internal personnel number 5524 (field Person in Charge ). The precise allocation to the order can be traced back via the index reference . Here it is possible to view all allocations to the process. If a weighbridge ticket also existed for this order this would also be shown correspondingly. The index Time shows the logged data related to the process. This means that if the user had indicated start time, end date and end time on logging the order, these data would be carried along correspondingly. On the register Lines the text lines are issued which were logged for this event. Here it is possible to generate both automatic text lines and also manual additions by the user for each process if required. Definition of event codes Events can be pre-defined by the user. This occurs via the event codes enwis waste Location/ operational journal/Lists/event codes ) Event codes can be created in line with the processes which are to be recorded in the operational journal. The individual event codes can be divided into event groups. A group can cover the area of returns for example. For this group it is then possible to allocate different event codes such as e.g. incorrect material deliveries, wet or proportions of foreign matter. On the register rules it is possible to define rules for each event code. These are activated on creating the event. Via the field _Automatic Ex. Text Lines-_Option it is possible to define whether the text in the text area is to be transferred automatically. The following options are possible: Insert : the text lines are already transferred on creation of an event On Posting: the text lines are only added on the actual posting of the event The field Time Mandatory determines whether the user has to consign a time indication on creation of the event. The following options are possible: : no time indication is necessary Starting-Time : Indication of the start time Starting/Finishing-Time : Indication of the start and finish time If the field Calculate Duration is ticked, the corresponding time duration is established by the system automatically via the time indications. Further rules can be defined by No. of Rules . Further rules for the creation or posting of the events can be determined via the event posting rules. The following option values can be selected in the field Type: Person in Charge Site Location Code Plant Action Result In line with the posting rule it is possible to define by line whether a certain value needs to be indicated on creation (=option: \"Code Mandatory\") or whether a certain value must match on creation (=option: \"Same Code\"). In the example below a storage location must be consigned in the event so that it can be posted. Create events directly via an order In principle the transport, equipment, personnel and waste ledger entries generated with an order are logged automatically. This means that only manual intervention is required by the user if additional documents are needed. Events can be applied via the following link: Order Line Actions (Ctrl. + F10) Line Make Event Event A new window opens in which a new event document is applied. This event document can be further processed and posted correspondingly. The rules and texts defined in the code are used automatically as soon as the event code has been selected. You can make further additions in the text field. The references to the order can be accepted into the document by the system automatically. Create event via a weighbridge ticket The same possibilities to generate an event via an order also exist for a weighbridge ticket via the link ACtions Function make event event A new window opens in which a new event document is applied. This event document can be further processed and posted correspondingly. The references to the weighbridge ticket can be accepted into the document by the system automatically. Create event via a journal Events can also be created directly via a journal enwis waste location/operational journal operational journal . The desired event code must be selected in this case as well. Recurring events If operational processes can be described via several different event codes (and possible measures and result codes) and these processes occur repeatedly at time intervals, they can be applied as a recurring event. Recurring events can be applied in the event document via the button Recurring events . Recurring Events Template opens. This can be defined like a \"normal\" event document. Any number of events can be generated via these recurring event templates."

    "title": "Customer Task Site Plan | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "The task site plan General The task site plan is the most frequently used enwis tool for order logging. It accelerates the order processing and makes a stronger separation between the administrative and operational area possible. The functions described below are also available analogously for the vendors and vendor task sites without this continuing to be mentioned explicitly. The various locations, branches, depots etc. of the customers are designated as customer task sites. Any number of customer task sites can be consigned for each customer. There always needs to be just one customer applied even if services are performed for it at various locations. The customer task site plan does in principle meet three different functions: it provides the operation with a customer independent overview of all customer task sites in terms of content which is optically structured it allows the processing of existing customer task sites and the application of new ones without the customer card having to be viewed or branched out to. Administration and accounting on the one hand and order logging on the other can be separated from one another without any problems. In this way writing permission can only be granted to the administration on parts of the customer task site plan e.g. customer card and order logging it is the starting point for a quick order logging and it assists the operational area as an optimum starting point for customer calls. It assists the order logging as an information source for the quick detection of customers and the managed application of orders. The following types of customer task sites are distinguished: Customer base task sites Operational customer task site In line with the example of the contacts in the marketing module the type Customer or the type task site can be allocated to each customer task site. It can however only be allocated to one customer task site per customer of the type customer . The customer task site with the type Customer is to be understood as a customer base task site which functions as a heading in the customer task site plan and to which the operational customer task sites are allocated. Customer base task sites are displayed in bold in the customer task site plan. Customer base task sites are to be applied and used exclusively as a structural element. The operational business should be processed on the \"normal\" customer task sites. Application of customer task sites It is recommended that at least two customer task sites are applied for each customer: a customer base task site and an operational customer task site. Both are identical with the customer. The customer base task site should in principle be blocked for operational processes. Operational customer task sites can be incorporated into the customer task site plan in any amount. enwis provides a routine which makes the creation of customer base task sites and operational customer task sites easier. From the customer card there is a possibility via the link actions create create base task site of starting a batch process which applies the two recommended customer task sites for each customer automatically (customer base task site and 1. operational customer task site). Before the start of this batch process a few default settings must still be made in the set up. In the register Numbering of the waste management set up the number series for the customer task sites must be consigned first of all. The fields Cust. Task Site Nos., Base Cust. Task Site Nos. are relevant for the customer area and Vend. Task Site Nos. and Base Vend. Task Site Nos. for the vendor area. In this context a particular significance is attached to the field Cust./Vend.No. is Base Site. With these fields there are three different systems for the numbering of customer and vendor task sites: Customer base task sites and operational customer task sites access the same number series and are therefore numbered consecutively regardless of their different status. If this is desired, the same number series must be consigned in the fields Cust. Task Site Nos. and Base Cust. Task Site Nos. The field Cust./Vend.No. is Base Site must not have a tick in it. In order to emphasise the difference of the two customer task site types, various number series can be consigned for the base and operational customer task sites. The numbering of both customer task site types then occurs independently of one another. In order to emphasise the equality of customer base task site and customer the field Cust./Vend.No. is Base Site can have a tick placed by it. Then each customer base task site receives the number of the associated customer automatically. This is the recommended standard configuration of the customer task site plan. Note It does however only function if the customer numbers have a maximum of ten digits as the customer task site number may only be ten digit. The method of the batch processing and thus also the basic structure of the customer task site plan must be defined in the set up of the menu enwis Dispatching / Dispatching/ Administration /Setup /Dispatching Setup ) . Here it is possible to use the option field Auto Create First Task Site to define whether and in which way an operational customer task site is in principle applied in addition to the base task site. The following options can be selected: Never The first operational customer/vendor task site is in principle not applied Vendor Task Site) A first operational vendor task site is only applied for vendors. No first operational customer task site is applied for customers. Customer Task Site) A first operational customer task site is only applied for customers. No first operational customer task site is applied for vendors. always The first operational customer/vendor task site is also applied if this is possible The field Base Mask Ext. Task Site decides whether the services of all customer task sites of a customer are displayed or only the services (contract lines) of the selected customer task site on displaying the contract lines of a customer task site. Even if this field is set to the value \"Yes\" and it is thus specified that only the services of the current customer task site are to be displayed, the remaining services of the customer are displayed very easily. Via the function Clear Filter all remaining services of the customer can be displayed. The field Base Task Site Mandatory can be used to specify that operational customer task sites for a customer can only be applied if a customer base task site already exists. If the field is ticked it is not possible to apply an operational customer task site for a customer for which there is not yet a customer base task site. With the help of this function it is possible to control so that the customer can only be used operationally via the quick order logging if it was cleared by applying of the customer base task site for set up of operational customer task sites. With the fields Copy Address to Base Task Site it is possible to specify whether the customer base task site is provided with a postal address. Note As the customer base task sites only represent structural elements for the customer task site plan it is recommended that they are not furnished with an address. The address data would only disrupt a search for addresses. The field Block Base Task Site can be used to define blocking modalities. As customer base task sites only represent a purely structural element and are not used operationally, they should in principle be blocked. The following options can be selected: Manual The customer base task site is not blocked automatically. Blocks must be made and reversed manually in the customer task site plan Default The customer base task site is blocked automatically on application. It can however be unblocked again Always The customer base task site is blocked automatically on application and it cannot be unblocked again manually After the parameters for the batch processing for generation of customer task sites have been defined, the link actions create create base task site can be used from the customer card to generate customer base task sites and operational customer task sites. In this only customer task sites are in principle applied which are not yet present in the system. If a customer base task site was already allocated to a customer, it does not receive a second one via the batch processing. The first operational customer task sites are only applied for the customers which do not yet have any. Following completion of the batch processing, enwis issues a message regarding how many customer base task sites and first operational customer task sites were generated. A customer task site plan generated according to the standard process would look as follows: The customer task site plan contains all task sites ordered by customers. The base task sites (the customer as it were) are in bold. All associated task sites are slightly indented below. Each customer base task site is provided with the number of the corresponding customer here. The customer base task sites do not contain any address data. A first operational customer task site is applied automatically to each customer base task site which refers back to its own number series and also includes the address data of the customer. Additional offices, branches...were not yet shown. This can occur manually via the customer task site plan. Such additional customer task site plans can be created via the button new task site directly from the customer task site plan. The customer task site is inserted into the customer task site plan where the cursor is located. In this way it is automatically allocated to the corresponding customer. Task site In its structure the customer task site card is similar to the customer card and provides comparable functionalities to this, albeit with a reduced scope. A difference between customer and customer task site card is that there is no connection from the customer task site card to the enwis marketing module. Only the particular aspects of the customer task site card in comparison with the customer card are dealt with below. The fields Shipping Agent Code, Driver No. and Territory Code originate from the standard of Business Central and are normally not used in enwis. The field Registration No . is needed within the framework of notifications. The approval process for international shipment of waste according to the EC Waste Shipment Regulation is designated as notification. The register number is a process related number for the waste creator. The waste creator can apply for registration numbers from its responsible authority in order to use these for the recording of company internal waste management processes. With the fields Reference to Mun. Customer or Reference to Mun. Object the enwis module can be used to display the commercial contract lines for a customer, meaning if the customer is consigned as both a communal and a commercial customer in enwis. In the fields Distance and Duration on the register card waste management the spatial and time distance to the customer task site can be consigned. The three option fields Waste Compare Type, EWC Compare Type and Service Compare Type refer to the enwis compare catalog functionality. Both a positive and a negative catalog can be consigned to each customer task site and also each warehouse location. Each catalog can also refer to the three feature classifications Waste material, EWC number and Service type). In concrete terms this means that a positive catalog can be compiled for a customer task site which contains the services which can be performed there and which also lists the waste materials and/or the EWC numbers which may be transported away from there. Conversely a negative catalog can be compiled which contains exactly the services, waste materials and EWC numbers which may never be provided for this customer task site and which may never be picked up from there. enwis can be set in such a way that an adjustment between orders being carried out and the catalogs consigned occurs automatically. Whether work with a positive or negative catalog is to take place can be decided for each customer task site or storage location on the basis of the method for which the input time is lower. If only a few services are defined for the customer, a positive catalog is provided. If the customer can obtain all services apart from a few, a negative catalog appears to make more sense. Corresponding positive and negative catalogs must be consigned to the customer task sites so that this function can be used. Whether an adjustment between potential orders and the consigned catalogs is to be initiated automatically and manually is defined on the customer task site card via the three option fields Waste Compare Type, EWC Compare Type and Service Compare Type. There are four options available for each of the three feature classifications Waste Material, EWC and Service Type: Blank means: no automatic adjustment occurs even if catalogs were consigned. If an adjustment is desired, this must be started manually from the order. Via the two options Positive Cataloge / Negative Cataloge it is specified that an automatic adjustment is to take place first of all if this customer task site is touched upon by the application of contracts, quotes or orders and that secondly the selected catalog is to be used. The option \" Both \"starts an automatic adjustment for which both catalogs are used. It may initially make little sense to work with both a positive and also a negative catalog for the same customer or vendor task site and even to have both checked where necessary but it can be helpful in practice. It is definitely conceivable that the positive catalog is not correct or is even updated cyclically so that missing materials can be managed or delivered there if necessary. On the other hand an entry in the negative catalog should make clear that certain materials may not be disposed of for this customer under any circumstances or certain services be obtained by a supplier under any circumstances. Working with the customer task site plan The customer task site plan allows a quick identification of customers and their locations (customer task sites). It makes all relevant documents and data available for the generation of new orders. A new customer task site can be applied via the button new Customer task site . The customer task site is allocated to the same customer as the customer task site on which the cursor is currently located. A new customer task site is applied and the corresponding new customer task site plan is faded in for further processing. All relevant information is available directly from the overview of all customer task sites in the header of the customer task site plan. The quote, contract and order lines among other things for this customer task site can be called up via this link. And the current receptacle and rental inventories and the dispatched receptacles/containers for this customer task site. The customer task site plan is normally the most important tool for the order logging. The following possibilities are available to the user: Call up and processing of all price and discount information Overview of the the current receptacle inventory or the dispatched receptacles Access to all documents consigned in enwis (quotes, contracts, orders,...) for this customer task site Quote, contract and order lines are presented as so-called customer task site lines. The original context of the document is closed and appears as document lines belonging to the customer task site. Quote, contract and order lines of the current customer task site are displayed in red. From this line view it is possible to access the underlying document via the link show document and this can still be changed if necessary. Via the link Navigate it is possible to view or consign additional information on the customer task site (e.g. service errors and texts preceding and following invoices). This information is identical to that which can be called up via the customer card. The essential function of the customer task site plan is however the quick order logging through which a new order can be very easily created in an input screen which can be individually shaped on the basis of the contract lines present. Dispatching overview of the contract lines of a customer task site All contract lines to the current customer task site can be called up from the customer task site plan via the button contract Lines . In enwis contract lines are the services defined for the respective customer or customer task site. The contract lines represent the individual service catalog for the respective customer task site. Here it can actually involve lines of an existing contract but this is not a requirement. It is possible to present the contract lines as the section relevant for the customer from the complete service catalog. All the relevant information (e.g. receptacle type, waste transfer note...) can be provided for these services on the contract line so that they are immediately available in the contract lines overview. In addition further information in the form of line observations can also be consigned. A work flow is the basis for this procedure. The work flow assumes that the sales and marketing department makes agreements with each customer about the services to be performed and fixes the price of them. The operational area (order acceptance or dispatching) should then only access these defined services. If the customer requires further services, these must first of all be offered by the sales and marketing department and consigned in enwis in the form of a contract line. This procedure is not compulsory; in principle all services can of course be recorded and performed for each customer in each order. But it is a prerequisite for optimum use of the controlled quick order logging. It can be made compulsory for individual users or operational areas if a comprehensive, independent order logging is not to be enabled. If the contract lines for a customer task site are called up via the link Contract lines in the header of the customer task site plan, these are displayed in their own contract lines overview of the quick order logging. The contract lines of the current customer task site are displayed in red. The other customer task sites of the current customer are presented in normal script. Whether the services of all customer task sites in the page shown above are displayed on displaying the form or just the services of the selected customer task site is controlled in the dispatching setup via the field Base Mask Ext. Task Sites. Even if this field is set to the value \"Yes\" and it is thus determined that only the services of the current customer task site are to be displayed, the remaining services of the customer can be displayed very easily if all filters are released. (Actions Page Clear Filter or Ctrl + Shift + A ) . It is possible for the user to also work with the contract lines which have not been marked in red (contract lines of other task sites of the current customer) if the correct customer task site is not found straight away."

    "keywords": "Dispatching Code Dispatching codes – General The dispatching codes are of central importance for work with QuickDoc. Dispatching codes are set up in the menu enwis Workflow/administration/dispatching code . They can be consigned in services or contracts or selected via QuickDoc. The following is controlled via the dispatching codes: The appearance of the form for the quick order recording, meaning which fields are displayed in this form. The possibility of data input, meaning whether the user can just view the fields or also change them or make inputs in a few fields (so called mandatory fields) Dispatching codes with the document type Order can be used directly from the menu interface or from the customer task sites without referring back to the contract or order. Dispatching codes with the document type Contract can only be called up from the contract form or from the customer task site plan with reference to the contract lines. Dispatching codes control which contract lines are displayed in the customer task site plan. Only contract lines with a dispatching code are displayed in the customer task site plan and are available for processing. The sequence in which the contract lines in the customer task site plan are shown The data transfer from the contract into the order. When using QuickDoc an order is generated from the selected contract lines with which all data from the contract are initially transferred into the order. QuickDoc provides the possibility of overwriting, adding to or deleting the data (depending on the system setting) and these changes can be written into the order. The dispatching code controls whether and which data the user may change and what effect the changes made have on the order. Due to the many possibilities of use for QuickDoc and the dispatching codes which must be matched to it, it is necessary to consider carefully prior to setting up the dispatching codes how QuickDoc is to be used and in which master data the dispatching code is to be consigned where appropriate. The recommended standard work flow for this would be to assign a dispatching code to all services which are then consigned in the contracts and displayed in the customer task site plan via the contract lines. In this way it is ensured that each contract line receives a dispatching code and it also guarantees that all contract lines are shown in the customer task site plan. Dispatching code - General set up One significant aspect in the setting up of dispatching codes is that the sequence of the contract lines in the customer task site plan is aligned to the alphanumeric code of the dispatching code. In principle the display of the contract lines in the customer task site plan is sorted according to the dispatching codes. The contract as a bundle of contract lines broken up into its component parts and newly arranged. In order to achieve meaningful sorting, the dispatching codes can each be designated an alphanumeric code which ensures that the waste management lines do in principle appear first for example. Any number of dispatching codes can be set up. Dispatching code card Dispatching code - General register The fields of the register card general individually: The field Document Type is used to define which document type the dispatching code refers to. QuickDoc forms which are to be opened from contract lines must have a dispatching code with the document type = Contract . QuickDoc forms which are to be used without reference to a contract must have a dispatching code with the document type = Order. The option field Dispatching Batch Lines can be used to define a sequence of dispatching codes which determines a sequence of QuickDoc forms which must be processed consecutively by the user. If this function is to be used, dispatching codes must be applied first of all which are to be incorporated into a batch. Via the link Navigate dispatching dispatching batch lines additional dispatching codes can be assigned to the batch dispatching code. In this way an equipment line is first of all applied for processing of the subsequent dispatching batch and then a waste management line is applied in the order form. The corresponding QuickDoc forms are offered consecutively for processing which lead to generation of the corresponding order lines. The QuickDoc forms generated from a dispatching batch all lead to the same order. The field Dispatching Batch has the following options: Disabled The dispatching code does not contain a batch or this is ignored. Even if additional dispatching batch lines were assigned to the code, these are not addressed when calling up the dispatching code. Active incl. The dispatching code contains a dispatching code batch. In this process the \"cover sheet\", meaning the dispatching code, to which the batch is attached is also taken into consideration. If the dispatching code is called up, the corresponding QuickDoc form is opened first of all. Active excl. In this option there is a jump straight into the batch, into the subordinate dispatching batch lines. In this process the dispatching code, to which the batch is attached is bypassed. When calling up the dispatching code, the QuickDoc form is opened first of all to which the number 1 was assigned in the batch via the field Sequence (order). If the field Start with Service No . is ticked on the dispatching card, then the service number does in principle appear first under the header in the QuickDoc form. Note The service number is in principle characterised as a mandatory field by QuickDoc. It is not possible to generate an order in QuickDoc without recording a service. It is possible to stipulate via the field Filter Service No. Lookup by according to which criteria QuickDoc selects the suitable service for data which have already been captured. This function is meaningful when calling up QuickDoc without reference to the contract line, thus when QuickDoc is opened directly from the menu Waste Producer Processes or Waste Disposal Processes from the customer task site plan without branching onto the contract lines and from the standard order form. If the customer rings up for example and orders the provision of a certain container, the case worker enters the customer, the equipment type \"Submission\" and the equipment type in QuickDoc where appropriate and receives a very strong selection of possible invoicing services. The system behaviour for waste management orders for which associated services can be established on the basis of an initially provided waste type is analogous to this. Whether work takes place with this function is dependent on the design of the work flow. For dispatching codes with the document type \" Contract\" it is necessary to view the field Filter Service No. Lookup by and select the option \"Blank\" as the contract line already brings the service. If the service is in principle input first of all when starting Quick Doc without reference to a contract, the option \"Blank\" should also be selected as the collection of the necessary data is otherwise rather troublesome. The option Material, Equipment or Both only makes sense if these data are input first of all and the suitable service is to be established on the basis of this guideline. Note These options are however counter-productive if the service is in principle input first of all and further data are only entered afterwards. When validating waste management services, in QuickDoc (unlike in the normal contract and order form) there is in principle no automatic data transfer of the service into the fields Material Code and EWC Code . For the option \"Blank\" , the user is however guided out of the field Material Code into the waste materials catalog which is attached to the service. When validating this number the linked EWC code is written into the corresponding QuickDoc field automatically. If the field Filter Service No. Lookup by was however set to an option other than leer , this guidance of the user through QuickDoc is omitted. The user must then compile all data manually which are actually already connected with the service. It is possible to stipulate via the field Show Availability whether a check of the availability of personnel, transport and equipment and the storage capacities takes place in the QuickDoc form at the same time. For this purpose the corresponding capacities of the individual resources in the system must be present. The availabilities of transport groups, vehicles, personnel groups and also drivers is shown in the QuickDoc form behind the corresponding fields. If several lines are marked in the contract lines overview of the customer base site plan, in order to create an order, the QuickDoc form is opened with e.g. 1/3 pages depending on how many contract lines have been marked. If an external document number is entered on page 1, then this document number is also transferred onto pages 2 and 3 if a corresponding tick has been placed in the field Synchr. External Document No. This applies analogously for the fields Synchr. Ext. Bill. of Del. No., Synchronize Task Date , Synchr. Target Start Time. and Synchr. Finishing Time. If a tick is placed in the field Post Equipment , the equipment is posted immediately on creation of the order with QuickDoc, meaning that the equipment does no longer have to be posted separately. If the field Service No. is validated in the QuickDoc form, in an equipment service (work flow type = Equipment), the value is transferred from the field Default Qty. Equip. Services into the field Quantity of the QuickDoc form. The field Workflow Type is important for the dispatching code if QuickDoc is called up from the customer task site plan without reference to a contract. Dispatching codes which define suitable QuickDoc forms for this special application must have the document type \" Contract\" and have a tick in the field Force Workflow . Then the dispatching code forces a QuickDoc form which differs from the contract line. For clarification the three different types of dispatching code are characterised once again in brief below: Dispatching Code Document Type = Contract Dispatching codes with the document type Contract which determine the appearance of the QuickDoc form from the contract line. This can be seen as a standard variant of the use of QuickDoc and thus of dispatching codes. The field Workflowart has no significance here. QuickDoc is started by the function Create Order. Dispatching Code Document Type = Order Dispatching codes with the document type Auftrag which are addressed from the customer task site plan without reference to contract lines. Here a dispatching code with a suitable work flow type must be available for each of the various buttons in the header of the customer task site plan. Dispatching code Force Workflow Dispatching codes of the document type Contract with a tick in the field Force Workflow . These dispatching codes can override the dispatching code in the contract line and force the fading in of \"its\" form in QuickDoc. Here too a unique dispatching code must be present for each variant of the order creation from the contract lines of the customer task site plan. This variant of the order generation and the work flow type must match (equipment order = Equipment Workflow type). The work flow type is only the filtering criterion via which the correct dispatching code is assigned to the function button. The field Workflow Type of the dispatching card has the following options which are activated as filter criterion on calling up of the corresponding function: Defined Default Service Waste Mgt. Equipment The way in which the content of this allocation is filled via the dispatching code is down to the user. It definitely makes sense to design content appropriate QuickDoc forms for the buttons Disposal Order and equipment order . Here the function designations prompt a content relationship for function and QuickDoc form. On the other hand there is not such a content reference with regard to the functions Default Order and Service Order. With the help of this function it is possible to make additional QuickDoc forms available for the special order types. The appearance of the QuickDoc form is not determined via the field Workflowart but exclusively through the settings made in the other fields of the dispatching code card. With a value in the field Minimum QuickDoc Height (Min=0/Max=18480) a minimum height can be set for the QuickDoc screen. This means that if the QuickDoc screen is very small due to the settings in the dispatching code, it can be enlarged by a corresponding value in the field Minimum QuickDoc Height . Dispatching code - Register Selection The appearance of the QuickDoc form is determined via the register selection of the dispatching card. The following options in the fields present can be set: Disabled A field with this option is not displayed in the QuickDoc form and can consequently neither be viewed nor processed. Not Editable A field which cannot be edited is displayed for information purposes but no aspect of its content can be changed by the user. Active An active field is displayed. Data can be entered, changed and deleted there. Mandatory Data must be present in a mandatory field. The data can originate from the underlying field and they can also be overwritten. A mandatory field must not, however, be empty. If a mandatory field is empty it will not be possible to complete the order logging with QuickDoc with the creation of an order. The screen shot below shows a dispatching code which has been developed for the recording of equipment. Only the fields Equipment No . and Equipment Entry Type have been declared as mandatory fields as a complete recording of equipment orders does not make sense without recording of these two fields. The field Equipment Application was set to the option \" Active\" because an equipment application is frequently linked with an equipment order but it is not absolutely required. Data can thus be entered here. An order can however be created without an equipment application. All other fields - up to the field Service No . - were deactivated. Note A service number must in principle be entered in each QuickDoc order. The field Leistungsnr. is always a mandatory field. Obligatory fields which appear in each QuickDoc form as standard are as follows: Dispatching code Customer Customer Task Site Service No. Quantity Task Date Apart from the service number, the fields are not mandatory fields which are checked on the part of the system, meaning checks do not take place to ascertain whether data have been entered in these fields. If no fields have been declared as mandatory fields in the dispatching code, enwis only checks whether a customer and a service are present in the QuickDoc form. The field Service No. is in any case a mandatory field, for which the register Selection of the dispatching code card only makes the selection between the options Editable and Not Editable available*.* This means that there is only one possibility for selection here regarding the changeability of data. The option \" Not Editable \" (cannot be edited) is only meaningful in dispatching codes with the document type Contract in which the order line also has the service number which the user may no longer change where appropriate. In dispatching codes with the document type Order by contrast, for the field Service No. it is necessary to select the option Editable as order recording with QuickDoc is otherwise impossible. As this field is empty without contract reference on calling up QuickDoc and an entry needs to be made by the user. Another aspect of the fields of the register Selection is that there are partial interactions between the settings of the individual fields. If the field Waste Code is deactivated for example, this results in a few fields on the right hand side only appearing dimmed and they can no longer be controlled. The background to this is that for a QuickDoc form in which no internal Waste Code can be captured all additional indications with reference to the internal materials (e.g. EWC code, waste transfer note, storage location) are superfluous and thus no fields should be made available for this in the QuickDoc form. Dispatching code - Register display In the register anzeige (display) of the dispatching card form IDs can be consigned. The forms specified open in the QuickDoc form on Lookup from the fields Location, Bin, Waste Code and Equipment. On consigning a corresponding Lookup-ID it is thus possible not to jump from the field Lagerort of the QuickDoc form into the standard location overview but into the dispatching overview for the individual locations. In this way it would be possible to assign a suitable location depending on the visible capacity of the various locations. The register transfer of the dispatching card is linked to the register selection in terms of structure and partially in terms of functionality. In the register Auswahl it is possible to specify which fields the user can view and in which fields he can make changes. In the register übertragung it can or must also be specified to what extent these manually made changes are taken into consideration on data transfer from the contract into the order. The settings in both registers should therefore be matched to one another. In the register transfer the option Always or If not empty should as a rule be allocated to active fields or mandatory fields. Example: A customer orders the provision of an ARC50. The case worker does however only find a contract line for the provision of an ASM7 in the customer task site plan. In the QuickDoc form the field Equipment No. is set to the option \"Active\". The case worker therefore changes the ARC50 predefined by the contract to ASM7. If, in the register Tranfer , the option Never was selected for the field Equipment No., this entry of the case worker is ignored by enwis. The change can be made in the QuickDoc form but the ARC50 consigned in the contract appears in the order created. For the option Always on the other hand the change is taken into account on the data predefined by the contract, meaning that the ASM7 is transferred into the order. Neither of the options is recommended as a standard setting. Instead all fields of the register Transfer should be set to the option If not empty. The option If not empty means that changes made by the user are transferred, up to deletions. This means that if the user changes from the ARC50 predefined by the contract to ASM7, then this will be written into the order. If he should however remove the Equipment No. completely, this deletion is ignored and the data from the contract are accepted into the order. The following options are available in the fields of the register card Transfer: Always If not empty Never These options define which data or which changes from the QuickDoc form are written into the order thus created. Here it is necessary to distinguish between various types of dispatching code. Via the fields in the register transfer it is possible to control the extent to which the user can intervene in the data transfer from the contract into the order. The aforementioned options have the following effects: Always All entries and changes made by the user in the QuickDoc form are transferred into the order. All deletions of data which are consigned in the contract are accepted into the order, meaning that if the user has deleted default data from the contract line in the QuickDoc form, these will be missing in the order. If not empty Deletions made by the user are not transferred. All other changes he has made are written through into the order. This is the recommended standard setting for the use of QuickDoc from the contract lines. Never Regardless of what the user enters in the QuickDoc form, the predefined data from the contract are accepted into the order unchanged. The user has no possibility of intervening in the data transfer from the contract into the order. QuickDoc is then an extended copying function which only makes it possible to check the data to be copied from sight. In the register selection it is specified which fields the user can view or process in the QuickDoc form or in which fields data must be present. Dispatching code - Register Transfer Via the register transfer it must additionally be specified what effect changes or deletions of data on the contract line made by the user may have. For the option Never in the fields of the register transfet the user has no possibility of changing predefined data from the contract sustainably. He can change the data in the QuickDoc form where necessary but these changes are not transferred to the order created. Instead enwis persistently goes back to the contract line during the order creation and ignores the changes in the QuickDoc form made by the user. For the option Always on the other hand all changes made by the user are also transferred into the order. Order and contract may therefore differ in terms of content or the order may be incomplete because deletions of data made by the user are copied into the order. The recommended standard setting is the option If not empty. For this option only changes to data are transferred, meaning when predefined data are replaced by other data in a field. Deletions are ignored on the other hand. If the user deletes data without entering new values, enwis goes back to the default data of the contract line. This option is suitable for all fields in the register transfer , to which the option Active or Mandatory was assigned in the register selection. These fields are designated as workable in the register transfer . Therefore changes made by the user should also be transferred into the order."

Manually created contract to compare with This is a typical enwis contract being created manually: Setup the document template In the document template page in the General tab a code and description gets setup. Then the line structure for the contract gets defined. In this case we have 3 subcontracts – with fixed values in the Sub contract field - for submission, exchange and for final pick-up with 1 to 3 lines for each sub contract. In the lines some services get defined with a fixed value as this is always applicable for the \"7 cbm skip\" type of contracts. Beside this the following place holders get defined: The customer which will be defaulted from the header as we will see later. The task-site which will as well be defaulted. The material service for the hazardous waste. We'll see later how this gets filtered to only the applicable services. The location where we dispose the collected waste: Setup a filtered place holder A place holder gets defined by: A unique Code A description The decision to apply a filter on the table or to select values from the table manually The related (master data) table The filter for 3 The field to be copied to the document when using this place holder The description to be copied to the document if applicable Place holders can be marked as mandatory or optional And for easier visibility for the user the selectable items – due to 3 and 5 - get listed in the items tab: To filter the services in this example you have to have a clear selection criteria which was the service group in this case: Create a contract using the document template Create the contract header (as usual) The contract creation start as usual with an empty contract: In the contract header you populate the usual fields like: Customer Task-Site Valid period ...for the contract Create the lines via document template Now you call a function to setup the contract lines via a document template In the pop-up page you select the appropriate template (1): After you validated your selection for the template you get prompted with a sub page to enter the values for the place holders: CUST and CTS placeholder got defaulted from the header as you see. So you only have to enter: The location and The hazardous Material Service When you drill into the values to choose from for the hazardous material services you are limited just to those services being related to hazardous materials due to setup of the place holder \"HZ MAT S\" seen earlier: Now you pick the one used in the manual example contract. The document template tab helps the user to see where the place holders are used in the template: Then this is the resulting contract, with the following remarkable informations: The line structure is created like defined in the document template The hazardous material service is used in line 3 and 6. The location is used in those lines as well. Due to the proper setup of the contract, the contract uses the same prices as the manually created contract: Compare with manualy created contract: Guidelines for document template setups The setup for the document templates is always a balance between: Creating specific templates with mostly fixed values for fast creation of often used services. This will end in a huge list of templates so which might become a challenge for the user to pick the right one. Creating templates with quite restricted place holders to clearly guide the user. This will lead to lots of templates. Creating \"flexible\" templates which allow the user to choose from a lot of values for each of the place holders which makes this data entry more demanding and time consuming. Leave some fields in the template undefined and force the user to maintain those data manually in the created contract. As not all fields/data are available via the templates this is necessary anyhow in some circumstances but might be an operational solution for more cases. Following the above example contract above some possibilities to setup document templates for this example should give you an impression how you might proceed in a case like this. Fully predefined document templates If a special service is widely used in the company and makes up for several % of the contracts it might be worth it to setup a document template with basically all fixed values. An example might be smaller wheelies with a widely collected material like wood: So in the contract creation process the user input is quite limited: Setup the contract header as the data customer and task-site are always specific for a contract and need to be populated manually. Pick the docment template But in the place holder page nothing is left to do except clicking OK: Flexible template To allow to reduce the number of templates it's possible to leave the place holders open. So this template is usable for all kind of equipments and for hazardous waste: But the user needs to pick from a huge list of services for the 3 additional place holders during the contract creation process: An alternative would be to work with just one equipment service which in this case can be fixed and let the user only pick from the list of equipments once: With the following pop-up page during contract creation: But be aware that the description of the service will be a little bid ambiguous in this approach. ( For reports like delivery papers or for the invoice you might enrich this description with the equipment information but might confuse the user in pages. ) Partly defined templates Instead of the approach to split the templates by the equipment (service) you might split the templates by materials: With the following pop-up: Further guidelines The given examples are very much simplified. In real business you might need to setup lots of additional document templates due to other special conditions of a business case like: Service with cycles / without cycles Service with sub contractors Additional parameters to be defined Additional services to be foreseen .... This will enlarge the list of templates much further which has to be kept in mind when thinking about the best approach."

    "title": "Fundamentals for working with quotes, contracts and orders | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Fundamentals for working with quotes, contracts and orders General One of the essential properties of enwis is the continuous data flow which makes the multiple input of data superfluous. All documents build on one another or pass their data onto the relevant downstream stage of the business process. A continuous passing on of data occurs between quotes, contracts, the various order stages and finally the invoices generated from them which is only added to with additional information in the course of order processing. The central data container is never the form header - thus not the header of quotes, contracts or orders - but in principle the apparently downstream line. The various lines of a form are completely autonomous of the header and one another and they contain all data which enwis requires for the data processing. The form header is essentially only a user friendly screen which structures the otherwise very unclear and apparent chaos of the order lines. This means it is possible to show order components for different customers and vendors and a mixture of customers and vendors in a contract or order. Example: The customer collection of waste from a customer's premises can be put together with the vendor related transfer to the disposal site. It is also possible to bundle order entries with reference to any customer task sites and vendor task sites of the most varied vendors and customers in a contract or an order. Quotes, contracts and orders form the basis of the operational business in enwis. All three forms have a largely analogous structure but very different functions. They do in principle consist of a header and any number of lines. The data of the customer or vendor are consigned in the header. The lines represent the individual quote, contract or order entries. The functionalities in the operative business in the customer and vendor area are largely analogous functionally as they are generally in enwis. Therefore subsequent reference is made only to customers which can as a rule be interpreted as \"customers and vendors\". Both billable and non billable services can be defined in the order. Company internal processes can be shown for example for which nobody is billed but for which the cost in terms of personnel, material and machines is to be recorded for cost accounting purposes. In enwis orders are not just for the depiction of the external and accounting relevant exchange processes with customer or suppliers but also for the capture of operationally induced services which are either not invoiced at all or not invoiced in this form. The essential difference between contract and order is of a temporal nature. The order is a one off action which is carried out on a particular date. The order can be defined as an interrelated bundling of business processes which is meaningful in terms of content and time. The order or the order line is the basis of the dispatching and also the invoicing. The order thus forms an enclosed operating process and it captures all the linked costs and proceeds. In the contract on the other hand a longer term agreement with a customer or supplier about certain services is consigned. The contract is used as a copying template for the creation of orders. It already contains all relevant data - business partners, conditions, services, prices etc. - which can easily be copied into the order and only need to be provided with an order date. The contract always remains present in the system; it can easily be referred back to. The order by contrast has been completed once it has been processed and it should also be deleted as the system is otherwise unnecessarily bloated. Orders which have been completed and invoiced are marked with a corresponding tick so that they cannot be invoiced again. On posting, the completed order is either deleted, archived or it remains as a completed order with the notification that it was already posted. It is possible to set whether the completed order remains as such following posting, or it is archived or removed completely in the Invoice Setup register general in the field Del. Compl. Orders on Posting. The posted, completed order is however no longer functional; it cannot for example be referred back to for the creation of a new order. It therefore makes sense to make the setting for routine deletion of completed orders or the archiving of the order when posting. Orders are the most important document type in enwis. The application of quotes and contracts is not absolutely necessary in enwis. Orders must be applied in order to be able to show the business processes in enwis. A work flow with a recommended business process is described below. Work flow document flow The recommended work flow could look as follows: Creation of a contact in the menu sales und Marketing from MS Business Central for the purpose of creating a quote for potential new customers. This makes sense as only a few data have to be entered for a contact and the customer list is not unnecessarily bloated by a number of data sets which may never result in a business relationship. Creation of a quote for this contact if it involves a potential new customer or for a customer if he is already listed in the system. Quotes can be applied under the enwis Order Processing waste Producer Processes quotes . If a business relationship comes about via a quote, a customer can be created from the contact through the push of a button and a contract or an order can be created from the quote. Orders or contracts can only be created for customers. If a longer term agreement with the business partner is involved, a contract should be created from the quote. Contracts can be applied under the menu enwis Order Processing waste Producer Processes contracts. The conversion of a quote into a contract can largely occur automatically. Contracts can of course also be applied directly without the presence of a quote. The contract presents the copy template for the later orders factually. The order by contrast is the one off implementation of a contract. If a short term business relationship or one off business is involved, an order can also be created directly from the quote. Otherwise the contract can be used as a copy template for the repeat creation of orders. In both processes the order creation is largely automatic as the order created by pushing a button accepts the essential data from the basic quote or contract. Orders can of course be applied directly without prior creation of a quote or contract. Orders can be applied under the menu enwis Order Processing waste Producer Processes orders . It is recommended to work on the basis of contracts in principle as the system is thereby maintained continuously and it is always possible to access the same database for evaluations. The associated additional cost for the copying of orders from contracts is negligible. During the course of order processing, data (e.g. disposed quantity, vehicles used and employees etc.) can be added and changed. In this way differences between the originally agreed and the actually rendered services can be documented. For monitoring of this further order processing and data maintenance the Order Header has the field Status available on the register posting. The following option values are available in the field Status : Order logging, dispatching, follow up entry and final control. Whether and how these are used individually can be stipulated depending on the company. A work flow control is thus possible within the order processing/dispatching department. Order logging, dispatching and control can for example be assigned to various employees or areas for example which receive the orders presented for processing depending on the respective status. Example: Following completion of the logging of an order in the call centre, it is set to the status Dispostion . Only orders with this status are dispatched. In the subsequent status Nacherfassung the input of weighing data and other follow up entries occurs. The order clearance either occurs immediately or the order is set to the status \"Completion\" so that the data captured can be checked once more if necessary. The order clearance makes every order into a completed order regardless of its previous status. With the clearance the posting of the disposed waste or recyclable material quantity to the warehouse occurs. At the same time the completed order is available for invoicing. Posting in the general ledger as a result of the clearance does not yet occur. Therefore the clearance can also easily be withdrawn and necessary corrections can be added. The completed order is still in the area upstream of the general ledger. A cancellation of completed orders is neither necessary nor possible. Note It is important to take into account the fact that the quantities posted on the clearance are not cancelled by the withdrawal of the clearance. Waste management, equipment, transport and personnel entries must be cancelled manually where necessary. This applies particularly where the clearance was withdrawn in order to correct these quantity indications. In this case the entry to be corrected must in principle be cancelled before it is corrected and entered once again. Invoices are generated automatically from all completed orders through the combine invoicing carried out monthly for example. The combine invoicing can be called and carried out in the menu enwis invoicing combing invoicing combing invoicing . These invoices are not compulsorily entered first of all and can instead be checked as pro-forma invoices, agreed with the recipient where appropriate and also deleted once again where required. If this appears too inconvenient, the combine invoices can also be used to create directly posted invoices if people wish to rely on the fact that the orders already contain the correct data. It is however recommended to only create the actual invoice following the final check of the pro-forma invoice by posting it. The posting of costs and proceeds in the general ledger accounts and the formation of process cost ledger entries occurs at the same time. An invoiced order can be deleted. The movements connected with the invoicing on the general ledger accounts can however be cancelled if necessary. The accounting effects of a final invoiced order cannot be removed from the system without trace in line with the principles of appropriate bookkeeping and this can only be done by making the cancellation retrogressive. In this way the originally created ledger entries remain in the accounts."

  "documentation/Order Processing/LineEntries.html": {
    "href": "documentation/Order Processing/LineEntries.html",
    "title": "Line Entries | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Line Entries General Information The four fields, Qty. to Dispose , Qty. to Handle , Qty. to Drive , and Qty. to Work , are short cut fields on the entries associated with the line. Qty. to Dispose = Waste Entry Qty. to Handle = Equipment Entry Qty. to Drive = Transport Entry Qty. to Work = Personnel Entry The entries associated with a line can be opened by clicking on the corresponding icons in the sales order. The sales order is organized into three logical hierarchies in enwis: Any number of order lines can be set up for each sales order. Any number of line entries can be created for each order line. The \" Qty. to \" fields or the Operational Qty. field and the corresponding line entries are generally used to record non -billable operational services. The four \" Qty. to \" fields are automatically filled by enwis when the service on the service card is assigned to a specific service type and a value has been entered into the Operational Qty. field on the order line. Then the value in the Operational Qty. field is transferred to the corresponding \" Qty. to \" field. This makes these \" Qty. to \" fields intermediate stations between the Operational Qty. field and the line entries. Example: The service type Disposal, combined with an entry into the Operational Qty. field creates an entry in the Qty. to Dispose field and the resulting waste entry. It works the same for the other three \" Qty. to \" fields, which will be filled automatically when a value in the Operational Qty. field is entered in the master data. The following principle applies: All billable services must be on the order line, because line entries are generally not relevant to the invoice. One of the core functions of enwis is to distinguish between billable services and all other services, e.g. those recorded for inventory management and analysis. The invoice quantity will be recorded in the Quantity field on the order line; all other quantities, e.g. quantities to dispose, go in the line entries, and this basic data can be copied to the \" Qty. to \" fields. The line entries are posted to their own entries for internal analysis when the sales order is released, and they might need to be reversed like accounting entries if they have been posted incorrectly. Setup The Entries field under the Entries tab in Waste Management Setup defines whether line entries will automatically be set up for an order line. In general, an entry to a line is only set up automatically if other conditions are met: The basis of the sales order must be a service. The unit of measure code must be unique. If the service is a waste management service, it must be specified with an internal waste code. If the service is an equipment service, it must be specified with an internal equipment number. If the service is a transport service, it must be specified with an internal vehicle number. If the service is a personnel service, it must be specified with an internal employee number. This information can be entered manually on the order line or directly into the corresponding line entry using the Waste Code , Vehicle No. , Driver No. , Co-Driver No. , and Equipment No. fields. Only the waste code and the equipment number can be entered directly into the service record, so that they can be automatically transferred to the corresponding fields in the order line and the line entries when the service is validated. Data Flow The direction of data flow must be considered when working with line entries. Data flows back and forth between the \" Qty. to \" fields and the Operational Qty. field. Between the order line and the line entry, however, it only flows in one direction, from the line to the entry. Note Changes to the \" Qty. to \" fields are copied to the Operational Qty. field. The flow of data or the order of entry in enwis from the master data on the service card to the order line and finally to the entries created from the order line can be depicted as follows: Service type Disposal Operational Qty. Qty. to Dispose Waste Entry Waste Ledger Entry as basis for inventory management and waste accounts Service type Equipment Operational Qty. Qty. to Handle Equipment Entry Equipment Ledger Entry and Rental Value Entry as basis for container inventory and the rental invoice Service type Transport Operational Qty. Qty. to Transport Transport Entry Transport Ledger Entry. The transport ledger entry is crucial for processing sales orders, because it constitutes the basis for dispatching. The transport ledger entry is also the basis for cost accounting at a later stage. Service type Personnel Operational Qty. Qty. to Work Personnel Entry Personnel Ledger Entry as basis for timekeeping and cost accounting. Personnel ledger entries can also be used for dispatching. The \" Qty. to \" fields and the Operational Qty. field are helpful for entering data into the line entries without having to switch from the order line to the entries by clicking on the corresponding Line icon. Note Changes to the entry are not transferred back to the order line! Whatever is in the line entries is the critical information for data management in enwis. Information in the line entry generally takes priority over information in the order line. Qty. to Dispose Field In terms of content, the Qty. to Dispose field and the corresponding waste entries represent stock movements. For this purpose, enwis creates the aforementioned waste entries in the background, which are posted as either inbound stock or outbound stock. The waste ledger entries represent material flows in waste management and recycling companies. This makes them the basis for inventory management and for creating waste accounts. However, it is not possible to enter negative values into the Qty. to Dispose field. The two fields, Waste Entry Type and Route Type on the order line define whether the content of the Qty. to Dispose field represents inbound or outbound stock. The following options are available for the Waste Entry Type field: Receive/Ship, Disposal, Recognition, Derecognition, Transfer, and Route. Together with the entry in the Qty. to Dispose field, the waste entries \"Receive/Ship\" and \"Recognition\" represent a positive waste ledger entry, that is, a quantity of material added to the inventory. In contrast, the waste entries \"Disposal\" and \"Derecognition\" represent a negative waste ledger entry, that is, a quantity of material removed from inventory. Qty. to Drive Field Using the Qty. to Drive field, transport services are represented, the corresponding transport entries are created, and finally posted as transport ledger entries with their unit cost. Transport entries are therefore the basis for dispatching. At the moment when a transport entry is set up, it is available as a task for dispatching in the enwis Dispatching menu. The unit to be used--\"deployments\" and \"hours\" are available for transport--will depend on the base unit of transport and must be entered manually in the transport entry. Only numerical values can be entered in the Qty. to Drive field; the actual meaning in understood when combined with the unit in the transport entry. Qty. to Work Field Using the Qty. to Work field, personnel services are represented, the corresponding personnel entries are created, and finally posted as personnel ledger entries with their unit cost. Only numerical values can be entered in the Qty. to Work field as the base for employee deployments. Whether this refers to minutes, hours, or days will be saved in the employee group or users will have to enter it manually in the personnel entry. Qty. to Handle Field The equipment number for the order line and for the equipment entry will be recorded in the Qty. to Handle field. Together with other information, this constitutes the basis for automated rental invoice creation in enwis. Because rental invoices are mostly automated, there is no information in the Qty. to Handle field regarding the duration of the equipment rental, just the number of the equipment rented out. The rental duration is calculated automatically by the system. When setting up rental orders, it is important to understand the principle of rental invoicing in enwis. When an equipment order is created, an order line or an equipment entry with the type \"Drop Off\" will be set up. This represents the start of the rental duration for the equipment rental invoice. When the equipment is physically and factually dropped off with the customer, the sales order will be released and, in contrast to the other entry types, enwis will automatically create two types of ledger entry from the equipment entry: an equipment ledger entry and a rental value entry. The equipment ledger entry represents the actual quantity movement of equipment, while the rental value entry forms the basis for invoicing the rental. These two types of ledger entry allow the inventory movement and the invoicing to be cleanly separated, because the actual equipment inventory with the customer and the equipment rental billed to the customer are not usually the same; they tend to differ in terms of content and/or time. When the rented equipment is picked up from the customer, a new sales order is created with an equipment entry of the type \"Pick Up\". When released, a second equipment ledger entry is created that offsets the rental value entry. Therefore, rental value entries represent the open, billable equipment still in the possession of the customer. An equipment ledger entry is \"opened\" when the equipment is dropped off and \"closed\" when the equipment is picked up. Posting Line Entries When working with enwis, the time when the various entries are posted, i.e., the time when the corresponding ledger entries are created, is very important. In principle, this occurs when the sales order is released, meaning it is not dependent on when it is invoiced or posted in accounting. The moment when the sales order is flagged as completed, and thus released for invoicing, the line entries associated with the sales order will be posted. However, for ledger entries to be posted, there must be an internal waste code for waste entries, a vehicle number for transport entries, an employee number for personnel entries, and an equipment number for equipment entries. Furthermore, the quantity cannot equal 0; otherwise, there will be nothing to post."

    "title": "Order Header | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Order header General As contracts and orders are largely structured analogously, i.e. they have the same fields with a largely identical function, the structure of order headers is presented in detail below. In everyday business, orders are the instrument used most frequently by enwis and they do as a rule have the greatest information content. General register New orders are in principle applied with Ctrl + N. On the register General the obligatory fields to fill in are the fields Nr . and Geschäft mit Nr. All other fields in the order header are optional. The field Geschäft mit Nr. is filled semi-manually by the selection of a customer, the field Nr . by contrast is filled automatically by enwis. The field No . is filled automatically with a number from the number series consigned for this following activation of the return key. The customer for whom the order is created is stipulated via the field Business-with No. If the function orders is called up in the menu Waste Producer Processes , enwis branches off automatically into the list of customers. The application of a vendor order is not possible from this position. In principle the trigger or customer for this order should be named via Business with No** . * It is possible to combine various vendor and customer components in an order via the various order lines but each order line also carries the identified customer via the field Post-with No.* In the field Business-with Contact No. the customer's contact person responsible for this order can be selected. This contact must be applied in the menu sales & Marketing beforehand. The fields Business-with Name to Business-with Contact are filled automatically by enwis by the previously input numbers and on the basis of the data consigned there. The entries made by enwis can in principle also be overwritten manually. The correction of the master data is however as a rule more sensible at least when long term data changes such as e.g. changes of address for the customer are involved. The field Order Date is filled automatically by enwis with the work date. The content of the field refers to the date of application of the order. If necessary the setting made by enwis can be overwritten manually. The field Task Date refers to the intended date for completing the order. The field Task Date is primarily important as input assistance for the entries belonging to the line. The current work date is input by the system as standard here. Any other date can however also be entered manually here. The dispatching date is transferred from the line to the entries belonging to the line. The dispatching date of e.g. waste entries becomes the posting date of waste ledger entries and is thus decisive for the time determination of the stock inflow. The field Order Code provides the possibility of setting up internal sorting or filtering criteria via which batch processing e.g. the combine invoices can be controlled. Orders can be classified and invoiced jointly via order types. In this way it is for example possible to capture all rental orders in an invoice run via an order type code \"Rental\". Task site register The fields of this register also serve the definition of default values for the order lines which can be changed once again manually as required. The relevant task site is found via the field Task-at Code . The following fields are filled with the name and address data consigned in the task site. In principle any number of task sites and reference points of different vendors and customers can be combined in one order. If there are a variety of customers and vendors in the order lines, no pre-settings should be made in the order header. Transport register The two fields Distance and Driving Time are of subordinate significance and can only be used meaningfully if all order lines refer to the same task site. The fields are filled from the fields of the same name of the customer or the task site on application of the order. If the distance and travelling time to a particular customer task site are consigned then this is also transferred into the order. Posting register The fields Currency Code and Language Code are Business Central standard functions. Foreign currencies and foreign languages are input here where appropriate. For customers for whom invoicing takes place in € and with whom communication occurs in German, these fields remain empty. The field Posting Date can be filled automatically by enwis or manually by the user. In the Waste Management setup/Register contract/ Posting Date of contr . Orders it is possible to pre-set which date should be entered here. There are four options for selection: the order date, meaning the date on which the order was applied and which is again the work date as standard the dispatching date, meaning the date on which the order is to be carried out the posting date if one is specified by the contract the work date which is meaningful if the order date and work date differ The posting date of the order can thus either be placed on the posting date of the contract or on the order date or dispatching date of the current order. The posting date of the order header is only relevant for the invoicing if invoicing occurs directly from the order. Otherwise a new posting date is set in the course of the combine invoices. The field Delivery Status serves to meet legal regulations. The particular requirements of the waste directives and sampling directives make a precise tracking of hazardous materials necessary. For further information see documentation on the topic \" Delivery Status \". The field Status can be used for work flow control or for monitoring of the stati of the individual orders. It specifies the option values: Creation Dispatching) Processing Completion These options do however only have conditional functionality. The register Status of the waste management set up can above all be used to set certain actions such as entry creation, automatic counter entry or customer-vendor jumping which are triggered by a change in status. The way of otherwise filling in the various stati can however be freely defined by the user in terms of content and it must where appropriate be integrated into the work flow via corresponding individual programmes which are called on a particular change of status. In the field Job No . the order can be assigned to certain projects. Waste management projects are an important, price forming criterion in enwis. The allocation of contracts to projects is what primarily makes sense. It is also possible to apply each order automatically as a project so that valid prices can only be defined for this contract. In the field External Document No. default purchase order or order numbers or similar can be consigned by the customer. This is particularly useful if these have to appear on the invoices. The consignment does as a rule occur at the contract stage and it is copied into the relevant orders. In the two fields External Contract No. and External Call No. it is possible to enter contract, purchase order and order numbers of the customer. This information is as a rule compulsory for large companies and business with public facilities in particular so that the later invoicing can refer to it. These fields are only present in the order header and not in the contract header."

    "href": "documentation/Order Processing/OrderLine.html",
    "title": "Order Line | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Order line General In total there are over 50 different fields which can be selected on the order line. The most important ones are explained below. The diversity of fields can easily make the order line unclear. The user will however as a rule only need a fraction of the fields and should therefore fade out the majority of them in order to be able to move quickly among the fields which are relevant. Order line The option field Art provides the three following options and also determines the behaviour of the field No .: Blank selection of a text Service selection of a service Item selection of an article The standard option in the field Art is \"Service\". For the option \"Service\" the user is guided into the service overview, meaning the service catalog of the company, in the field Nr . and can select from the services defined here. Numerous data consigned to the services are transferred automatically into the order line on input of the service number in the field Nr . The service descriptions are transferred into the fields Description or where appropriate Description 2 of the order line. The fields Gen. Bus. Posting Group, VAT Bus. Posting Group , Gen. Prod. Posting Group und VAT Prod. Posting Group are extracted from the data consigned to the customer or service by enwis as standard. The costs and proceeds from the operational area are entered in the accounts of the general ledger via these posting groups on invoicing the orders. These fields are normally filled automatically by the master data consigned for the customer or service. Note If necessary these fields can be overwritten on the basis of the corresponding set up. This is however not advised. The case workers in the order logging should as a rule not concern themselves with the posting of proceeds on general ledger accounts. Posting groups should be maintained exclusively in the master data by the entitled persons. The field Posting Type stipulates whether a customer or vendor business is involved; depending on the setting in this field the branching from the field Buchung mit Nr . occurs into the customer or vendor list. The field Post-with No . is preallocated with the number of the customer entered in the order header. If various customers and possibly also vendors are to be activated in an order, this must be stipulated via the two fields Posting Type and Post-with No .. The customer or vendor task site are stipulated via the field Task-at Code of the order line. The invoice recipient can be specified via the fields Invoice-with No. and Inv. Sub-Adress Code and this can be done completely regardless of who was entered in the line or order header as a customer or vendor. As a rule the customer or vendor who is also captured in the field Post-with No. is also entered automatically into the field Invoice-with No. If for example a different invoice recipient is however consigned on the customer or vendor card (field Bill-to Customer No. on the register invoicing ) this different invoice recipient is written automatically into the field Invoice-with No. of the order line. The field Invoice-with No . on the order line can also be overwritten manually. Via the field Inv. Sub-Adress Code an invoice address consigned to the customer or vendor which is different to their main address is allocated. This invoice address must have been consigned to the customer/vendor previously on the customer/vendor card. The waste material or recyclable material is classified for waste management or transport orders via the fields Waste Material Code and EWC Code . These data are consigned in the master data of the service by many enwis customers so that both fields are automatically filled by these defaults. The field Waste Material Code refers to the waste material catalog defined by the company itself which is the basis of the inventory valuation for example while the field EWC Code refers to the official EWC catalog. Note **The field designations Waste Material Code and EWC Code are not permanently present in the system. Instead they can be set up in enwis as follows: enwis Services Waste Material Administration Material Catalogs Setup ** Here other designations can also be chosen for the fields Globaler Int. Material Catalog and Globaler Ext. Material Catalog depending on the wishes of the customer. Warehouse outflows and inflows or route business are depicted via the two fields Waste Entry Type and Drop Shipment Type. The field Waste Entry Type has the following options: Stocking Disposal Pos. Adjmt. Neg. Adjmt. Transfer Drop Shipment The entry types \"Stocking\" and \"Pos. Adjmt\" bring about a positive quantity movement in the warehouse, meaning that the storage quantity increases. The entry types \"Disposal\" and \"Pos. Adjmt\" bring about a negative quantity movement in the warehouse, meaning that the storage quantity decreases. The difference between storage (positive movement) and waste management (negative movement) on the one hand and inflow (also positive movement) and outflow (also negative movement) on the other is found in the fact that storage and waste management represent movement quantities with an external effect while inflow and outflow only have an internal effect. The entry type \"Drop Shipment\" can be used to enter and sustain business by inventory which is not processed by the company's own storage locations but goes directly from one business partner to the other. The entry type \"Transfer\" allows internally effective movements between two of the company's own storage locations to be posted. The fields Location Code and Bin Code are of central importance for the warehouse administration. In enwis it is possible to set up any number of storage locations and - as a subdivision of them - any number of storage bins. The available storage locations and bins can be accessed from the order line. If order lines are entered with storage location and/or bin, the waste and recyclable materials going in and out are entered directly on or from these storage locations or bins. This means that there is a control of the current inventories at any time. In the field Equipment No . the equipment type (e.g. the 5 cbm skip) is stipulated. In addition a concrete individual item of equipment can be assigned to each order line and each equipment entry via the field ID-Code such as the 5 cbm skip with the identification number 4711 for example. The option field Equipment Entry Type refers to equipment entries. It contains the following options: Submission Pick-up Exchange Clearance In terms of content various types of equipment movements can be presented via the field: a \"Submission\" means the transport of an item of equipment to the customer's site and set up there \"Submission*\"* the collection of an item of equipment from the customer \"Exchange*\"* refers to the exchange of an item of equipment for another one of the same type \"Clearance\" disposal of the waste contained in the item of equipment while the item of equipment remains at the customer's site. The settings made in the order line are transferred to the equipment entries belonging to the line or they can be overwritten there. This means that data for the equipment entry can be captured from the order line via the field Equipment Entry Type without having to change into these themselves. The invoice quantity is in principle captured in the field Quantity . The operational quantity is classified via the field Service Type and it is allocated the unit code consigned to the service. The content of the field Service Type comes from the master data of the corresponding service. The corresponding \"to-field\" is filled by the service and an entry in the field Operational Qty. and a suitable line entry is applied. The line entries contain the data e.g. equipment quantity which are decisive for the entry of the operational processes. Individually the various services have the following meanings: through the service \"Waste\" and an entry in the field *Operational Qty. the field Qty. to Disposal* is filled and a corresponding waste management entry is applied. The field Qty. to Handle is allocated through the service \"Equipment\" and an equipment entry is generated. The field Qty. to Drive is filled by the service \"Transport\" in the same way and a transport entry is generated. The field Qty. to Work is allocated through the service \"personnel\" and a personnel entry is generated. The field Operational Qty. and the fields Qty. to Disposal, Qty. to Handle, Qty. to Drive and Qty. to Work are only input aids in order to be able to generate line entries with the operational service data without having to change from the line into the entries. Note The data flow does in principle only run from the line to the entries and not in reverse. This means that inputs on the order line are transferred into the entry but changes made to the entry are not written back onto the line. In the field Unit Price the service price per sales unit, meaning per tonne or cbm etc, is either input by the user or established automatically by the system. It is recommended that a standard service price is consigned to each service and that this is varied in line with other price forming factors such as e.g. price group of the customer. Via a tick in the field Price fixed there is the possibility of fixing the input price in such a way that it can no longer be overwritten. But no price history develops when using this function. The field Quality Code can be filled automatically from the master data of the service or it is maintained manually in the order line. Quality codes can be defined completely free depending on the requirements of the company. In the area of waste management, additions of foreign materials, the purity of materials, the heating value and similar material properties can be shown. From a functional point of view quality codes are an important, price forming criterion which is taken into consideration by enwis for pricing. The field Delivery Code has an analogous functionality. Delivery codes as well can be defined completely freely in line with the requirements of the respective company. Transport distances or freight costs for example can be shown via the delivery codes. Delivery codes are also a price forming criterion. Via the field Job No. the order line can be allocated to a particular waste management project. Projects are particular framework agreements in enwis - e.g. the complete waste management of a large building site for which special price agreements were made if necessary. Projects are therefore also a possible price forming criterion. Projects can also be used as a filtering criterion during invoice sorting for example. The field Order Code provides the possibility of setting up internal sorting or filtering criteria by order codes via which batch processing e.g. the combine invoices can be controlled. In the field Concept No . a concept can be allocated to the order line. In enwis concepts serve to distribute service quantities, costs and proceeds to the participants (e.g. Interseroh) for business in which several partners are involved. Concept numbers captured in the order lines are written on the invoice entries so that it remains clear which concepts have triggered the distribution of costs and proceeds of a business transaction. In the field Commitments No . business obligations and their gradual processing which are frequently encountered in the waste industry can be recorded (e.g. Interseroh, DSD). Example: The sales department negotiates the annual removal of 10,000 tonnes of a particular waste material with a customer. This is the commitment. The material quantities do however result from a large number of small deliveries from other customers which can be recorded and entered via corresponding orders and lines. In the field External Document No. a default purchase order or order number or similar can be consigned by the customer. If such an external number has already been entered into the field of the same name in the entry register in the order form, the field External Document No. is then filled automatically in the lines of the order. Each order line can however have its own document number allocated if necessary. This must always occur manually. In the field External Bill of Delivery No. the number of an external weighbridge ticket can be captured for example if this needs to be additionally recorded for an external invoice number. There is a direct link from the order to the weighbridge via the option field Weighbridge Dispatching . Order lines which are set to the option \"Weigh\" in the field Weighbridge Dispatching are at present available to the weigh master as orders to be weighed. As soon as an order line dispatched for the weighbridge is linked with a weighbridge ticket, the field Weighbridge Dispatching is set to the value \"weighed\" on the order form so that the order is already no longer present when the overview of the dispatched orders is viewed for the next time. If a tick is made in the Weighbridge Setup in the register General in the field Auto-Transfer Weighbr. Result , the weighing data are transferred into the order line connected to the weighbridge ticket automatically during the weighing process. No more work is involved here in the order processing. The date of the service provision is captured in the field Task date. The dispatch date is set to the work date in the order header and the order lines by the system as standard. As a rule it must however be set to the dispatch date desired by the customer manually by the user on logging the order. If a dispatch date was already set in the contract, this is accepted in the order if an order is created from the contract. The way in which enwis transfers the dispatch date from the contract to the order can be controlled in the Waste Management Setup , Register contract via the field Contract Task Date (Default) . It has the four options: Create Transfer Create when blank Blank For the option \"Create\" the dispatch date is set to the actual work date of the system on order creation from the contract. For the option \"Transfer\" a dispatch date fixed in the contract is copied into the order. For the option \"Create when blank\" the current work date is taken if none was set in the contract. For the option \"Blank\" no dispatch date is automatically issued on application of the order from the contract. The user must do this manually. Via the two fields Cost Center and Cost Object each order line can be allocated to a cost center and/or cost object. The two fields are as a rule extracted from the master data consigned from the service. The field Invoice is in principle set to \"Yes\" by enwis. If individual order lines are not invoiced for any reason, the tick placed in the field Fakturieren as standard must be removed manually. These lines are not taken into consideration in the combine invoice. Via non billable order lines it is on the one hand possible to record services for customers which cannot or should not be invoiced (e.g. service errors) and on the other hand all internal company services. By placing a tick in the field Qty. Consolidation those order lines should be marked which are in principle to be calculated with quantity compressed in the combine invoice. Quantity compressed invoice means that similar invoice quantities from various orders and order entries which have occurred for a customer in an invoicing period are brought together as an invoice entry. The field can be set to \"Yes\" in the contract and thus transferred automatically to the order or only set to \"Yes\" in the order. Each order line to be invoiced can be controlled individually via the field Qty. Consolidation. In the field On Hold a maximum three digit code can be issued, e.g. the name abbreviation of the responsible case worker. The relevant order line for the invoices is blocked by any entry in this field. The field Comment cannot be edited directly. If some comments were assigned via the link action (Alt + F10) Line line Comments or Ctrl + S of the line, a tick appears in the field Comment . Via the two fields Contract No. and Contract Line No** .** each order from which a contract was created is linked with this original form. These entries cannot be overridden manually by the user."

    "keywords": "Quick order logging / QuickDoc Overview enwis QuickDoc allows comfortable order logging. A focus is a targeted user guidance which limits the input possibilities and thus also reduces the possibility of incorrect entries. The aim of the quick order logging is to specify a fixed, step by step work flow for the various types of order (e.g. equipment orders, waste management orders, ...) which guide the user and with which 80-90% of all orders can be processed. All the information required is made available to the user within this fixed work flow. There is the possibility of changing to the standard order form at any time where all functions of the waste management solution are available in case the processing of a special order makes more complex inputs necessary. The work flow focused starting point is the one which a customer calls in the dispatching, order processing or internal sales service when he wishes to place an order. It must be possible for the case worker to find the customer in the system as quickly as possible without any difficulties. The customer task site plan is the suitable tool for this. The customer task site plan contains all task sites ordered by customers. The base task sites (the customer as it were) are in bold. All associated task sites are slightly indented below. The use of QuickDoc together with the customer task site plan is of course particularly meaningful but it is not the only possibility. QuickDoc can also be started directly from the menus and from contracts and orders. Four different cases are to be distinguished when using QuickDoc: Calling directly from the menus Waste producer processes or waste disposal processes . Here there are no further data available to QuickDoc. It is opened virtually empty. Calling from the customer task site plan without branching into the contract lines beforehand. The data of the customer and the task site are available to QuickDoc and various QuickDoc forms for the application of various order types are available (depending on the selection of the dispatching code). Calling from the customer task site plan after one or several contract lines were selected beforehand. Data from the contract lines are thus loaded into the QuickDoc form and they can be checked and/or processed. Possible changes to the contract data are transferred into the order according to the default of the system. QuickDoc can also be opened from the standard contract or order form via the link Aktionen create QuickDoc . QuickDoc then presents a comfortable input screen which makes it possible for the user to switch between the customary line presentation and screen view. The Dispatching Codes are of central importance for work with QuickDoc. Dispatching codes are set up in the Menu enwis Workflow /administration /dispatching Codes . They can be consigned in services or contracts or selected via QuickDoc. The set up of dispatching codes is described in a separate document. Standard process The standard process for working with QuickDoc looks as follows: The order acceptance agent or the dispatcher selects the correct branch, office,... of the customer, opens the associated contract line and carries out the function make order from complete contract . In this way a QuickDoc form which matches the contract line is faded in, namely the one which is determined by the dispatching code consigned in the contract line. QuickDoc can however also be activated from the customer task site plan without reference to contract lines. There is the possibility of generating various types of orders in the header of the customer site task plan. If QuickDoc is called from the contract lines it specifies which dispatching code is responsible for the appearance of the QuickDoc form. If this reference is missing, this information must come from elsewhere. Therefore the correct QuickDoc form must be activated via the various buttons or the buttons must be allocated to the dispatching codes. This occurs via the work flow types. These functions are also available from the contract lines of a customer task site in an analogous fashion. In the standard option the QuickDoc reverts back to the dispatching code consigned in the contract and offers the corresponding QuickDoc form for further processing. The calling of QuickDoc from the contract lines is recommended as a standard process for several reasons: It is very easy to use the customer task site plan to select the customer and the relevant customer task site. If branching then occurs via the contract lines, the service catalog defined for this customer or the customer task site, in other words the contract lines, can be viewed and used as a template for the creation of an order. This is the easiest way to create a connection between the contract and the order when using QuickDoc. It is only possible to use the contract to see which orders for this contract have already been created if QuickDoc is called with reference to contract lines. This process allows a strict separation between the contract and price maintenance by sales and the simple order logging. The user in the order logging can view the contracts but has no possibility of changing them. Possibilities for deviating from the defaults of the contract can be controlled via the dispatching code. In order to use this function, dispatching codes are to be applied with the document type contract . The settings on the registers Selection and Transfer of the dispatching card are also important. There is also the possibility of disconnecting contract line and QuickDoc form from one another. This is useful if there is not yet a suitable contract line for the customer task site and an order nevertheless needs to be created. Then the order agent or dispatcher could select any contract line of the customer in the customer site plan and create a waste management order with reference to an equipment line for example and the reverse. In this case the order must be created via the function service order . If a suitable dispatching code is present, a waste management order is generated, regardless of the defaults in the contract line. Dispatching codes which define suitable QuickDoc forms for this special application must have the document type Contract and have a tick in the field Force Workflow . Then the dispatching code forces a QuickDoc form which differs from the contract line. Order application via Quick-Doc Use of QuickDoc from the menu interface If QuickDoc is opened directly from the interface of the menu Waste producer processes or Waste disposal processes , there is first of all now information about the customer, the contract, the service or the dispatching code available. The QuickDoc form is opened empty: It is only when a dispatching code (document type = Order) defined for this purpose is selected manually in the field Dispatching Code that the form is shaped in a way with which meaningful work can take place: Here the necessary data (e.g. customer, customer task site, service, equipment,...) can be input successively for the order logging: If the order logging is completed with \"OK\", the user receives the following message: enwis has created a standard order form in the background: Note No price processing can occur in the QuickDoc form. Prices cannot be viewed there either. Price maintenance occurs completely separately from the order logging and invisibly for those employees who work exclusively with QuickDoc. Prices are in principle automatically extracted from the service price table and written into the standard order form. The use of QuickDoc requires particularly thorough price maintenance as the price fixing thus removes control from the user. In the aftermath checks need to take place in the order created regarding whether a price has been fixed for each order line. Use of QuickDoc out of the customer task site plan without contract lines reference QuickDoc can be started in the customer task site plan without branching into the contract lines allocated to the customer task sites beforehand. The following options are available in the header of the customer task site plan: Default Order Service Order Disposal Order Equipment Order An individual dispatching code must be set up for each of the four order types if these buttons are to be used. The linking between the buttons and the dispatching codes is created via the field Workflow type on the dispatching card. When setting up the dispatching codes allocated to these buttons, it is necessary to consider the direction in which the data input will normally occur: In principle if the service is input first (e.g. because the service catalog is well structured and present for the user as a rule), the field Filter Service No. Lookup by is to be set to the option leer in the dispatching code. If on the other hand the concrete data such as e.g. equipment or waste type are captured from the corresponding catalogs and in the QuickDoc form, the field Filter Service No. Lookup by could be used to select one of the options Material, Equipment or Both . With this setting enwis establishes the appropriate service on the basis of the data already captured. Use of QuickDoc from the order lines in the customer task site plan From the contract lines of the customer task site plan QuickDoc is as a rule called up via the function create order from contract. In this way a QuickDoc form suitable for the contract line is opened. The appearance of this form is determined by the dispatching code which is consigned in the contract line. In addition the following functions are also available which provide a completely different scenario: Create Default Order from Contract Create Service Order from Contract Create Disposal Order from Contract Create Equipment Order from Contract These functions are provided to generate orders although no suitable order line has been consigned in the system. Example: A customer rings up and orders a container. Up until this point only waste management services have been contractually agreed with him and consigned in enwis. In this case the user could use the function create equipment order from contract and apply a corresponding order separate from any contract reference. For this purpose dispatching codes of the document type Contract are necessary, for which the field Force Workflow is ticked. In addition this dispatching code must show a work flow type which is suitable for the function button (e.g. create waste management order from contract work flow type waste management). This means a maximum of one dispatching code is to be set up for each function button. With this dispatching code it is possible to override the dispatching code of the contract line and to open and process a QuickDoc form which is independent of the contract line. Not all contract lines are shown in the contract lines overview however, but just those which have been marked as relevant for the processing via the customer task site plan by e.g. the internal sales service or the case worker responsible for the contract. In this way it is possible to define complementary services in the contract (e.g. maintain movement form or vendor counter postings) which can be automatically transferred into a new order via the subcontract number but which do not appear in the dispatching overview of the contract lines. This marking occurs in the contract via the field Dispatching Code . Only contract lines with a dispatching code are shown in the customer task site plan. Contract lines which are not to be shown in the customer task site plan must show a value leer in the field Dispatching Code . The contract lines are shown arranged by dispatching code in the customer task site plan. Further functions Detailed information for all contract lines can be displayed via the link NAVIGATE Line or Planning. The following information can be retrieved individually: Waste transfer notes connected with the contract line Capacities and availabilities of vehicles or transport groups, employees or staff groups, equipment, storage locations or storage compartments which are connected with the contract line the dispatching plans of equipment, storage locations and storage compartments Document comments and line comments via Line open equipment entries it is possible to show which equipment is at present at the selected customer task site. via _line open rental invoice _ the equipment for the rental invoice can be branched out. From this overview it is possible to simulate a rental invoice directly and the result can be displayed on the screen or printed out. via Line dispatching equipment all equipment is displayed which has not yet been placed, exchanged, emptied or collected for which dispatched orders are located in the system via _line show document_ it is possible to branch off directly from the contract from which the current contract line originates Via the link Navigate capacity the valid service and rental prices can be established, displayed and - if the user possesses the appropriate rights - also processed directly. The link _Actions create _ provides the user with the possibility of creating a concrete order via the contract lines overview. In doing so he has a choice of six alternatives: Create Immediate Order from Contract A new order is created directly from the current contract line. No additional inputs are required. The system decides automatically the way in which the new order is created: if the user has marked several lines in the contract lines overview, all marked lines form the basis for the order which is to be newly created if no line is marked, then only the contract line where the cursor is currently located is decisive if a contract line contains a subcontract number, then all contract lines with the same subcontract number form the order which is to be newly created The new order is generated automatically in the background. The user receives a message which states which new order was created from which contract. Via the link Show last Document it is subsequently possible to branch to the newly created order and make further entries where necessary. Create order from contract (Ctrl +U) The dispatching code is established via the current contract line (see above for explanation) and the relevant QuickDoc form is shown. The system distinguishes via the dispatching codes consigned in the contract whether e.g. an equipment order or waste management order is involved in the order to be created. There is no reason not to work with this option in principle as the user always receives the correct QuickDoc form. Create standard order from contract (for explanations see above) Create service order from contract (for explanations see above) Create waste management order from contract (for explanations see above) Create equipment order from contract (for explanations see above)"

Through this module it is possible to determine the exact location of a waste package from the customer task site to the disposal area. The waste packages are handled as products in the module and the equipments used in collecting these packages are defined as containers. The products and containers are basically tracked with the help of an object tracking worksheet in enwis. Since this worksheet records the movement of package at every incident, it also maintains a clear history of how the package has taken its path from the producer site to the disposal area. It is also possible to even find a package based on an attribute by using the value filtering of a specific attribute."

    "keywords": "Bottom Price General Information In general, prices are only defined for services. The price of a service can depend on a number of factors above and beyond the service itself. These criteria are either service-related and refer to the performance of a specific service, such as the service type, waste material, equipment, etc., in which case they are saved in the service price table , or they define the business relationship category, such as the posting type, balance account posting type, etc., and are found in the price group matrix . Bottom Price enwis offers the option to save a service-related bottom price; if the price drops below this threshold, the system interrupts the posting and sends users the corresponding error message. Setup To following settings are necessary for this option: The Recalculate Price field under the Prices tab in Waste Management Setup must be set to \"Never\". The Check Bottom Price box under the Prices tab in Waste Management Setup must be checked. A bottom price must be entered into the Bottom Price field on the service price line . Example of Bottom Price Users create a new waste management order with the service shown in the screen shot above. enwis copies the price saved in the service price table to the order line. Users create a second order and enter a price in the order line that is below the bottom price saved in the system. When they attempt to post the order, the following error message appears. The order line cannot be posted until a price is entered that equals or exceeds the bottom price. Note enwis does not check the bottom price until posting. If users wish, program code can be written to have it checked earlier, e.g. in a release routine."

    "title": "Lump Sum Prices | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Lump Sum Prices General Information The service price entered in the Price field is normally the basis for quantity-dependent invoicing (using the base unit of measurement for the service). The price per unit saved in the Price field is multiplied by the value entered into the Quantity field, which yields the line invoice amounts to be transferred to the Amount field. The lump sum price can be understood as non-quantity-dependent invoicing. Example: A quantity of 10 tons at a price of EUR 20.00 normally yields an amount of EUR 200.00 (quantity x price = amount). When a lump sum price of EUR 20.00 is set, the amount equals the price regardless of the quantity, i.e. EUR 20.00 (1 x price = amount). Each time the price is validated, the system refers to the service price line to see whether a lump sum price has been negotiated. In addition, if it finds one it will check the Lump Sum box in the document line. When users manually check the Fixed Lump Sum box, the system will not also validate the Lump Sum box and the amount remains as a lump sum or not for the future. This is how users can manually turn a price into a lump sum price. Save Lump Sum Prices for One-Time Use When a service should be invoiced as a lump sum service one time, and regardless of the quantity, then users must check both the Fixed Lump Sum and the Lump Sum fields in the order line. For example, an invoice quantity of 5 tons at a service price of EUR 15.00 would normally yield an invoice amount of EUR 75.00. In this example, the waste management service \"Construction Waste or Contaminants\" should be invoiced to the customer at a lump sum price of EUR 100.00 one time and regardless of the quantity. Users must take the following steps to do so: Activate the Fixed Lump Sum field (check the box), which prevents the system from validating the Lump Sum field. Activate the Lump Sum field so that enwis can process the quantity and units of measurement independently. This immediately causes the system to stop calculating the price based on quantity x price and base it only on price. Enter EUR 100.00 in the Price field*.* To prevent the lump sum price from being copied for the next validation or invoice (release), check the Price Fixed box. This field is useful for setting down spontaneous, non-recurring agreements with the customer or vendor in the contract or order line without having to edit the master data or service price line. This allows users to turn a price into a lump sum price spontaneously and exceptionally without affecting the price master data saved in the service price table. Save Lump Sum Prices for Permanent Use Users also have the option of setting negotiated lump sum prices permanently in a service price line in the contract line by going to Actions (Alt + F10) Prices edit price by criteria ; this option is also available in the order lines. Example: A waste management service should always be billed to a customer at a lump sum price and this agreement should be saved in enwis permanently in a service price line. Users must take the following steps to do so: Call up the edit price by criteria function. Check the Lump Sum box. Enter the new, non-quantity-dependent lump sum price in the Price field. Confirm the entry by clicking on \"Yes\". enwis updates the waste management line with the new values and checks the Lump Sum box so that it cannot be edited. The system has copied this price change permanently to the service price line ."

In the contract lines, there are various functions available for entering new prices and updating existing prices in the price records directly from the form by going to *Actions (Alt F10)__ Prices *: Track and edit price Edit price by criteria Filter price by criteria Edit rental price by criteria Filter rental price by criteria These functions are explained in more detail below. Track and edit price The track and edit price function is available in the contract lines by going to Actions (Alt + F10) Prices track and edit price ; in the order form it can be called up by going to Actions (Alt + F10) Function track and edit price . With the track and edit price function, users can set and view the price line to be used to calculate the service price in the current line. In the background, the pricing will be restarted and the service price line found will be copied to service price tracking . Conveniently, with a single mouse click, users to transferred to exactly the service price line that defines the price for the current document line. They do not have to go to the service card and click through the associated price list to find the relevant service price line. Note Normally, only the price line actually relevant to pricing is shown, unless the Price Tr. excl. Starting Date box under the Prices tab in Waste Management Setup in checked. If that is the case, then the pricing filter set in the Start Date field in the service price table will be deleted and the entire history of the service price relevant to the current document line will be shown. If users enter new price lines or track existing service prices, the pricing for the current document line will be immediately restarted, so that changes are copied directly to the document line from which the service price tracking was launched. Edit price by criteria The edit price by criteria function is available in the contract lines by going to Actions (Alt + F10) Prices edit price by criteria ; in the order lines it can be called up by going to Actions (Alt + F10) Function edit price by criteria . This function allows users to call up and edit prices from the documents. A record is created or edited directly in the service price table. The screen shows all pricing criteria and the price in card format. This means the edit price by criteria function is a very convenient option for adding and/or updating service prices in the service price table with the support of the system. The alternative to this is working directly in the service price table, which is accessible by clicking on the Prices icon in the service card . Preise über Kriterien filtern The filter price by criteria function is available in the waste management order by going to Actions (ALT + F10) Function The filter price by criteria . It displays the current service price line and gives you the option of setting different filters for the individual pricing criteria to get an overview of all prices defined in this respect. When calling up the service price filter , the filter criteria shown have already been filtered to the content of the corresponding fields in the document line. Users can edit the prices in the service price filter , but they cannot enter new price lines. When users make changes, the price in the current document line is automatically validated and, if needed, a new master data price is adjusted. New prices can be entered by clicking on the the filter price by criteria icon. Edit rental price by criteria The two functions, edit pricr by criteria and filter price by criteria , are also available for rental prices and work the same. Note here that the service price line of the current service is not displays. Rather, in the background, the system determines which service will be added to the rental invoice at a later point in time and shows this. All relevant criteria are considered. The system simulates an invoice just to find and show the service price line and to make sure it only arrives at the valid price line, it employs the invoice method code and the rental invoice group code in its logic and matrices."

  "documentation/Prices/ReferencePrice.html": {
    "href": "documentation/Prices/ReferencePrice.html",
    "title": "Reference Price | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Reference Price General Information Reference price groups allow users to set default reference prices for a service and define all customer-specific prices related to this reference price (e.g. EUWID). Adjustments to an individual service price, e.g. to accommodate market trends, can then be done at one central place, in the reference price group. Price changes made there are carried over to all service price lines associated with the reference group in the system. The two main fields for this are the Reference Price Group and the Reference Type in the service price line. To work with this function, at least one service price line must be set up with a reference price group and a reference type for each service whose price it should control. Reference Price Groups The prices in all service price lines to be assigned to such a group using the Reference Price Group field are not absolute prices; rather, they are surcharges and discounts to the reference price. When the Reference Type field is set to anything except , this price group thereby becomes a reference price group. How reference price groups work is illustrated in the following order line: The price from the order line is the sum of the reference price of EUR 120.00 from the service price line with the price group code EUWID plus the EUR 2.50 in the service price line with the price group code C00040 (see screen shot above). Reference Type To work with the reference price function, at least one service price line must be set up with a reference type for each service whose price it should control. The default reference price of the service is saved in this price line. The following options are available for the Reference Type field: Difference | The price in this service price line is viewed as a negative value. In other words, the reference price will be subtracted from the individual service prices. Negative prices are added according to the usual mathematical rules. ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Surcharge | The price in this service price line is viewed as a positive value. In other words, the reference price will be added to the individual service prices. Negative prices are naturally subtracted. Deduction | This has the same function as the \"Difference\" option. Range | This option only works if a price range is also set using the Minimum Price and Maximum Price fields. That means that individual prices defined according to the reference price group are only considered in the document lines if they fall within the price range set for the reference price group. Individual prices below the minimum price are automatically replaced by the minimum price, just as individual prices above the maximum price will be replaced by the maximum price. In reference price groups with reference type \"Range\", the Price field remains empty or is filled by default with the value of 0.00, because only the ends of the range, defined as the minimum and maximum price, matter for such reference price groups. Service price lines associated with reference price groups with reference type \"Range\" therefore typically appear as follows: Example of Reference Type \"Range\" Below we demonstrate an example of the reference type \"Range\". Scenario Reference Price Group: EUWID Reference Type: Range Minimum Price: EUR 60.00 Minimum Price: EUR 75.00 The Minimum Price and Maximum Price fields are only relevant for reference prices and only for the reference type \"Range\". They define a kind of reference price determination. Individual prices defined according to the reference price group are only considered in the document lines if they fall within the price range set for the reference price group. When this price falls below the minimum price, it will be replaced by the minimum price When this price exceeds the maximum price, it will be replaced by the maximum price. Setup Create a new service price line with the value \"EUWID\" in the Reference Price Group field. Enter the value of EUR 50.00 in the Price field. Create another service price line with the value \"EUWID\" in the Price Group Code field and the option \"Range\" in the Reference Type field. In this line, enter the value of EUR 60.00 in the Minimum Price field and the value of EUR 75.00 in the Maximum Price field. Note In reference price groups with reference type \"Range\", only the ends of the range, defined as the minimum and maximum price, matter. This is why the Price field remains empty. Sales Order enwis has found a minimum price of EUR 60.00 for this service. This is because the default price of EUR 50.00 (see previous screen shot) is less than the minimum price. If the range were to be expanded to a minimum price of EUR 35.00, then the default price of EUR 50.00 would be accepted, because this price falls within the defined range. Example of Reference Types \"Surcharge\" and \"Discount\" Below we demonstrate an example of the reference types \"Surcharge\" and \"Discount\". Scenario Reference Price Group: EUWID Reference Type: Surcharge or Surcharge Setup Create a new service price line with the value \"EUWID\" in the Reference Price Group field. Enter the value of EUR 15.00 in the Price field. Create another service price line with the value \"EUWID\" in the Price Group Code field and the option \"Surcharge\" in the Reference Type field. Enter the value of EUR 100.00 in the Price field. Sales Order enwis calculated a price of EUR 115.00 for the service on this order line, which is nothing more than the sum of the reference group price of EUR 15.00 plus the corresponding price group price of EUR 100.00. If the setup had been the same, but the reference type \"Discount\" had been chosen, then the EUWID price would be treated as a discount and subtracted from the price group price and enwis would have calculated a final price of EUR 85.00. In general, users can set up different reference groups and enter them in separate service price lines. Using the Reference Price Group field, users can have the system refer to this price group for pricing. The \"Difference\" option in the Reference Type field has the same function as the \"Discount\" option. Base Price and Reference Price By pressing the key combination Ctrl + Alt + F1 , users can zoom into the waste management line with the price surcharge. The type fields of Base Price and Reference Price have been filled in by the system. Here the Base Price field represents the price negotiated with the customer. The Reference Price field shows the reference price group associated with the reference type. These prices allow users to understand how the price on the order line was calculated. Note The two prices, the base price and the reference price, can also be shown on the invoice. This allows the customer to also understand how the price was calculated. Updating Reference Prices All reference prices (e.g. EUWID) can be updated in their own form. The reference prices serve to simplify this process. Here the prices for one price group are defined relative to the prices in another price group (e.g. the \"EUWID\" group). If the price in the reference price group (such as EUWID) is changed, all prices in associated groups will be modified as well. Go to enwis Services / Services / Service Prices / Reference Prices to see all reference price groups: This form allows users to conveniently view and edit the reference price groups. They have the option of filtering the list to show only certain price groups and a certain date. Then all associated services will be displayed for subsequent editing. Note For price groups to represent reference prices, the Reference Type field in the price groups screen must have a value other than ."

    "keywords": "Restriction of price criteria General The pricing in enwis can depend on many criteria but how many and which of the possible price criteria are used operationally in the respective company is dependent on the requirements of the business processes and price policy. In order to avoid mistakes and for reasons of transparency it is sensible to prevent or suppress the display of price criteria which are not to be used. The following price criteria can be excluded from the processing: Quality code Site code Delivery code Job No. Waste No. Equipment No. Business flow Posting type Unit of Measure Set up The price criteria which are to be excluded are specified on the register Prices of the waste management setup. Each of these possible price forming criteria can be deactivated by a tick in the corresponding field. The field confine price criteria must also be ticked here so that a suppression of price criteria does take place. If this field is not ticked then the deactivation of all remaining prices also remains ineffective. If Confine Price Criteria is ticked then this has direct effects on the possibility of price maintenance and the display of the price criteria. Effects All deactivated price criteria are automatically blocked out in the service price table and are not available to the user for price processing. The following functions for pricing and price editing are present in the operational area (in contracts or orders): track and edit price) edit price by criteria) filter price by criteria If the limitation of price criteria is consigned, then they are also not available or deactivated in these price overviews and views of the operational area. The function edit price by criteria for example does in principle only show those price criteria which are not deactivated. All deactivated price criteria are not displayed and they cannot be shown either. The dialogue window \"Change Service Price\" also adapts itself to the valid criteria in terms of size. If quality, site, delivery code and the project are deactivated as can be seen in the image above, then the following shortened dialogue is displayed: For the function filter price by criteria it is not only the corresponding fields of the service price line which are blocked and deactivated on limitation of the price criteria. The filter fields referring to these price criteria on the register general are also deactivated. Note The limitation of price criteria does not mean that these criteria are no longer used at all operationally. It does not mean that these criteria are no longer activated in the pricing either. They definitely continue to be part of the pricing but they play no role in terms of content because no values are assigned to them or can no longer be consigned. If a service price line with a price criterion was however applied for example before this price criterion was deactivated in the set up, then a consigned value continues to be price relevant and this service price line continues to be found and taken into consideration by the pricing."

    "keywords": "Service Price Worksheet (Change Prices) General Information The Service Price Worksheet is a way for the system to help users edit service prices. This function sets up a temporary table with the service prices on each line. The prices than then be automatically or manually changed and edited. Afterwards, the changed service price lines will be saved permanently in the service price table. The Service Price Worksheet can be called up by going to enwis Services/Services/Service Prices/Service Price Worksheet To better understand how the price worksheet function works, let's take a look at a concrete example of some service price lines. Service Price Worksheet -- Example Changing market conditions have made it necessary to make the following changes to service prices: The prices for certain services (e.g. construction waste) must be increased by 10%. The new prices should take effect on March 1, 2012. In addition, the new prices should be rounded to the nearest euro. Go to enwis Services/Services/Service Prices/Service Price Worksheet to open the overview of the service price worksheet. Note Make sure that there are no lines in the Service Price Worksheet form, because it serves as a template for creating new prices. Under the Service Price Worksheet tab, click on the Suggest price from service price to open the Sugg. Serv. Price Chg. (Price) window. A filter can be used in this window, e.g. to find the desired service number, under the Service tab. Additional restrictions can be imposed through filter criteria under the Service Price tab. In needed, for example, users could employ additional filters like waste material or the job number. This enables users to quite precisely narrow down the service catalog to form homogeneous groups of service price lines, so that uniform price changes can be executed in a sensible manner. Information can be entered under the Options tab that will then be copied into the new service price lines. The Start Date field is very important. Enter the date when the new prices should take effect here. This is important to be able to trace the pricing history later. In the Only Price Over field, users can enter a price limit; new prices cannot be entered unless the old price has reached this limit. All old prices that are below the price limit entered into this field are exempt from changes. A crucial aid is the Correction Factor field. Users enter the factor here by which all current service prices will be multiplied. A correction factor of 1.1, for example, means a price increase of 10%; a factor of 0.95 would mean a price decrease of 5%. We recommend that users select an option in the Rounding Method field. The rounding method defines how many decimal places to round to and which rounding method to use. Not defining a rounding method could result in the undesired result that service prices are calculated to more than two decimal places. Check the Generate New Price box if the adjusted or updated prices should be copied to the new service price lines. If this box is not checked, only the existing service price lines will be copied. Click on OK to initiate the Sugg. Serv. Price Chg. (Price) batch processing. Consequently, the temporary Service Price Worksheet will be filled by the system as follows: The list can still be adjusted and expanded manually, as needed. This overview is merely a suggested list. The new prices will not take effect until this list is actually accepted by clicking on the Implement Price Change icon. Click on the Implement Price Change icon to open the Service Price Worksheet: Initiate batch processing by clicking on OK. enwis will issue the following message: Clicking on YES to confirm will delete the proposed price changes. This again empties the contents of the Service Price Worksheet table. After being implemented, the new prices can be seen in the usual places, e.g. in the Service Price List :"

The following options are available: Never For Service Price For Rental Price Always In general, there are two different ways of showing this, by starting with an adjusted price line or with a price line that has not been adjusted; this can also differ regarding whether the users what so have a service price or a rental price shown. If the price editing should be started not adjusted, the edit prices by criteria function will be filled with all price-related criteria in the document line from which the function is called up. The might mean that no service price line matching the current combination of price-related criteria can be found, since not all theoretically price-related fields in specific jobs are actually used to define prices. The Service Price Exists field shows users whether there is a service price in the system that matches the selected criteria or not. The Last Start Date field can show indicate that, while there is no matching price line in the system, this is due to the currently selected start date and there is an exactly matching price line in the system with a different start date. These fields are updated each time one of the criteria on the screen is changed. If the edit prices by criteria function is started with price editing adjusted, the system first attempts to find a more general service price line in the system that matches as many of the criteria entered on the document line as possible. To make it clear to users that the price line found does not match all of the price-related criteria entered on the document line, the value in the Service Price Exists field will be changed to \"Adjusted\". Example: The illustration below shows that two price lines have been set up for the service \"Skip 5 m 3 Lid T.\" in connection with the customer \"D00340\". The only difference between the two price lines is that the delivery code is only found in the second line. Now a sales order is set up with three lines containing the same service, and the third line includes the delivery code \"AREA2\", which has no special price set up in the system. enwis correctly copied the price saved in the system to the first two lines. For the third line, enwis was unable to find any special price in the service price table for this combination of pricing criteria and therefore copied over the more general price, which matched most of the pricing criteria. If users call up the edit prices by criteria function, then the Criterion Line screen appears as follows: The Service Prices Exists field was changed to \"Adjusted\" to show users that there was no exact match for this combination of pricing criteria."

This difference depends on the type of bill of resources component: Components of the Service and Item type are transferred to additional document lines Components of the Person, Equipment, Transport, Costs, and Surcharge type are transferred to the corresponding entries on the document lines It makes the most sense to work with a bill of resources when all operating costs related to order processing are systematically recorded in the form of ledger entries. Example: Normally, for example, a specific vehicle type and at least one driver are necessary for waste management services. Therefore, it would be expedient to give each waste management service two bill of resources components: a transport group a personnel group The Auto-Explode Components box on the service card should be checked. This setting ensures that a transport entry and a personnel entry will be recorded for each service. By also setting the Check Transport Entry and Check Personnel Entry fields under the Entries tab in Waste Management Setup to the option \"Purchases\", \"Sales\", or \"Always\", users ensure that sales orders with these services cannot be released until these entries have been filled in, i.e. not until the driver, vehicle, and concrete task duration has been documented. This is a quite easy but very effective way to guarantee that all essential information in a sales order has been entered when the service is validated and that the sales order cannot be closed until all service information has been completely recorded. Service Components The type and usage of the bill of resources components is defined in the Type field in the service bill of resources . The Type field controls the No. field in the service bill of resources. Depending on the setting in the Type field, the Lookup function will bring up different tables in the No. field (e.g. an equipment list). Therefore, the Type field controls which component types can be stored in the No. field on the bill of resources line. An explanation of the different options for the Type field follows: Type: Service When this setting is used, the No. field brings up the service table . This allows users to assign one or more other services to the service in question using the service bill of resources. The services in the bill of resources are transferred to additional document lines when exploded. Each service in the bill of resources that can be assigned to a different service might itself have a service bill of resources. A service bill of resources might therefore feature a series of services all embedded in a chain of any length. It makes the most sense to save services in a service bill of resources when the main service is regularly associated with other services that might also need to be shown to the customer. This spares users the sales order preparation task of always remembering, for example, that when adding the service \"fecal sludge waste disposal\", they must manually add the associated service \"wash vehicle\". Type: Person When this setting is used, the No. field brings up personnel groups . This allows users to assign one or more personnel groups to the service in question using the service bill of resources. These personnel groups in the bill of resources are transferred to personnel entries in the documents when exploded. The system leaves this personnel entry incomplete, however; users have to fill in the document line with the concrete employee number and task duration. It makes sense to save personnel groups in a service bill of resources for all services that are regularly associated with a personnel entry in the documents. This is most expedient for services of the Person type, because the personnel group needed for the personnel entry can only be automatically assigned via the bill of resources. Type: Equipment When this setting is used, the No. field brings up the equipment numbers . This allows users to assign one or more pieces of equipment to the service in question using the service bill of resources. When this is to be used to depict equipment transactions that affect stock, it makes sense to also edit the Equipment Type field in the service bill of resources, i.e., to indicate whether the transaction involves the drop-off, pick-up, exchange or emptying of equipment. The equipment numbers and the equipment types in the bill of resources are transferred to equipment entries in the documents when exploded. It makes the most sense to save equipment in a service bill of resources for all services where equipment may play a role but that are not specifically equipment services. Note All information relevant to setting up services of the \"Service\" type, e.g. particularly the equipment number and the equipment type, can be entered directly into the service card, making it superfluous to save this information in the service bill of resources. Type: Transport When this setting is used, the No. field brings up transport groups . This allows users to assign one or more transport groups to the service in question using the service bill of resources. These transport groups in the bill of resources are transferred to transport entries in the documents when exploded. The system leaves this transport entry incomplete, however; users have to fill in the document line with the concrete vehicle number and the task duration or distance. It makes most sense to save transport groups in a service bill of resources for all services that are regularly associated with a transport entry in the documents. This is especially necessary for Transport type services, because the transport group needed for the transport entry can only be automatically assigned via the bill of resources. Type: Item When this setting is used, the No. field brings up the items . This allows users to assign one or more items to the service in question using the service bill of resources. These items in the bill of resources are transferred to new lines in the document when exploded. It makes most sense to save items in a service bill of resources when the items are a regular component needed to perform the service. Type: Costs When this setting is used, the No. field brings up the service table . This allows users to assign one or more \"cost services\" to the service in question using the service bill of resources in order to create cost/price entries in the documents. These \"cost services\" in the bill of resources are transferred to cost/price entries in the documents when exploded. Cost/price entries can be used to record company-internal costs when it does not make sense to document these costs in the form of equipment, transport, or personnel entries. Type: Surcharge and Deduction When the Surcharge and Deduction settings are used in the Type field of the service bill of resources, surcharges and deductions to the service prices in the document line can be calculated and copied directly to the Amount field in the document line. Certain settings are required to use these functions, as shown in the following example. A bill of resources component of the Surcharge or Deduction type only needs information in the Type and Value % fields, and the Description field, for logical reasons, so that the users and the customer know what it involves. The percentage value entered into the Value % field is the critical figure. This percentage will be applied to the usual service price in the document line and is visible in the difference between the price and the amount . Surcharges and deductions can be automatically or manually calculated, or not calculated at all. This setting is entered in Invoice Setup in the Calc. Surcharge/Deduction field under the General tab. The following options are available: Never: Surcharges and deductions are not calculated and therefore not copied to the document line Manual: Surcharges and deductions calculations can only be triggered manually in the document by clicking on the Calc. Surcharge/Deduction icon During Pricing: Surcharges and deductions are calculated automatically for the document line when pricing Always: Surcharges and deductions are also applied to prices entered manually into the document line The source of this difference is not visible on the document line; it is not revealed until users switch to the cost/price entry associated with the line, where the Surcharge/Deduction Type information in the service components has been transferred to. Process Type The Process Type field in the service bill of resources is normally only used in connection with Service type bill of resources components. The field features two options: \"Process\" and \"Allocation\". When a bill of resources with Service type components featuring the Process Type setting \"Process\" is exploded in the document, additional document lines with non-billable process services are created; these new lines allow the juxtaposition of revenues and costs directly in the document. Document lines of the Process Costs process type are always non-billable. Users can identify them by the fact that the Invoice box is not checked. Posting process service lines does not create any invoice ledger entries, but rather process cost entries, which can be reported separately."

    "keywords": "Service – Setup General Information Services are the core of the commercial aspects of enwis: In principle, it is always services that are bought and sold The only billable order lines are those recording services Prices can only be saved for services This makes services indispensable for depicting the commercial processes of waste management and recycling companies. Therefore, services are the enwis version of the default items in MS Business Central. On the other hand, services can also be linked with all other operating resources and procedures associated with service performance. Services can be entered with waste materials Services can be saved in person and transport groups Services can be linked to equipment Simple operating but non-billable expenses can be recorded in services Services can be set up so that they trigger an entire cascade of additional services The way these two aspects are associated with each other, that is, the service aspect relevant for invoicing and the one relevant to operations, can be entirely, freely defined by the users. Example: Users might define a service as \"Lump Sum Waste Disposal Petrol Station\" and link this with the waste material \"Used Oil\", the transport group \"Oil Catch Tank\", and the person group \"Driver\". Users can decide however they want the various aspects of this service to appear in the customer's invoice. Time required as measured in hours Quantity of material disposed Lump sum per task What follows is an explanation of how to set up a service. Register General The main fields on the General register are as follows: Each service has a unique identifying number that is entered into the \"Number\" field; this is how the service is addressed in the document line. When numbering services, keep in mind that a service catalog is frequently quite comprehensive and can easily contain several hundred or several thousand entries. The service number can help give the service catalog some structure. It might therefore make sense not to set up enwis to fully automatically assign service numbers, but rather than do this manually and systematically so that users can more easily identify them. Example: The numbering for all waste management services could start from 100010, while all equipment services start from 200010. When entering the service card in this example, then the user only needs to decide whether the service involves waste management or equipment, and then corresponding number is assigned automatically. Freely chosen text can be entered into the Description and Description 2 fields to describe the content of each service. The unit of measure used internally for recording the service is stored in the Base Unit of Measure Code field, e.g. the unit \"ton\" for waste management services or the unit \"hour\" for transport services, etc. enwis automatically copies the value entered into Base Unit of Measure Code in the service card to the Sales Unit of Measure Code and Purch. Unit of Measure Code fields under the Invoicing tab. enwis thereby offers the option to use different units of measure for the same service, so that internal operating procedures can employ different units of measure for invoicing customers and suppliers. Example: **Waste management services are recorded internally in tons but billed to the customer in m 3 .** If the Process Service box in the service is checked, then this service is not usable in normal order transactions, because it is not addressable in the order lines. Such \"process services\" are only designed to record company-internal expenses associated with an order line through a process ledger or through cost or price entries. This is why the system blocks them from being used as billable services in the order lines. Users can assign a delivery code to a service in the Base Delivery Code field. There are no restrictions on delivery codes. They can be used, for example, to define the form or the type of transport normally used to render a waste management services (flat-bed truck, container, vacuum truck, etc.). Delivery codes are part of the pricing criteria, i.e. different prices can be stored for the same service depending on the delivery code. Assigning different delivery codes to a service has to be done manually on the document line, because the service itself will only copy one delivery code, assuming any have been assigned to it. The one saved in the service as the base delivery code will be copied over to the order line, but there it can be manually overwritten if needed. The value entered in the Posting Type field, be it empty, \"Purchasing\", or \"Sales\", will control the field with the same name on the document line. This will define whether the service involved is for customers or vendors. If the Posting Type field here is left empty, the content in the Posting Type field on the document line will be controlled by the document header. If there is a customer in the header of the sales order, then all order lines recording services with an empty Posting Type field will automatically be set to the posting type \"Sales\". The Bill of Resources field cannot be edited directly. enwis will automatically enter the value \"Yes\" in this field when users establish a link between the service and a bill of resources by going to Associated Information Service Bill of Resources . In contrast, the Auto-Explode Components field can be edited directly. Checking this box means that the components saved in the bill of resources will be automatically copied over to the document. The Cascade Components field has a similar function. To understand cascading, remember that the components in the bill of resources of a service might also contain other services, and these services might also have a bill of resources with other components; when cascading, the components of both the original service and these associated services are all copied over. More information on the topic of the Bill of Resources can be found in the separate documentation. By going to Associated Information Service Extended Text , users can assign one or more extended text lines to each service; these lines are distinguished by starting date and they will be copied over to their own document lines. This can be set up to occur automatically when the service is validated in the document. To do so, check the Automatic Ext. Texts box on the service card. By default, the Search Description field on the service card is filled with the value from the Description field. However, this can be overwritten to include any entry. Services can be classified though the use of the Service Group Code field. This field is critical for generating automated rental invoices. The optional Service Type field mainly controls the relationship between operating quantities and invoice quantities and therefore has an indirect influence on the generation of service entries for a document line. Example: If the service type \"Waste Management\" is assigned to the service \"Construction Waste Management\", then enwis interprets entries in the Operational Qty. field in the order line as waste quantity and copies this value to the Qty. to Dispose field in the order line. Then enwis uses the service type to decide what kind of operational quantity is involved and, for example, automatically creates a waste management entry for a waste management line without the user having to switch to the Qty. to Dispose field or the entry. In principle, the service type should be based on the billable core of the service, i.e. an equipment service should sensibly contain the service type \"Equipment\" because this is critical for its operational processing and also for the equipment entry in the invoice. For more information on this, see the \"Line Entries\" documentation. Users can assign a dispatching code to each service in the Dispatching Code field. The disposition code controls the appearance and design of the enwis QuickDoc sales order form. It also determines how much employees are authorized to change the contracts when creating sales orders in enwis QuickDoc. For more information on this, see the \"Dispatching Code\" documentation. Users can assign a waste material to the service in the Waste Material Code field. The waste material of the service is automatically copied to the document lines where the service is validated. Naturally, this is mainly useful for waste management services. The code for the associated equipment is saved in the Equipment No. field. Here it is important to understand that this does not refer to the individual number of the actual piece of equipment, but rather to a group of identical equipment. For example, the equipment number ARC700 might refer to all roller containers with a volume of seven cubic meters. The equipment number will be copied to all document lines where the service is validated. Naturally, this is mainly useful for dropping off and picking up equipment. The type and direction of equipment movement is set in the optional Equipment Type field. The equipment types \"Drop Off\" and \"Pick Up\" are crucial for rental invoices. The equipment type \"Drop Off\" opens an equipment ledger entry that later needs to be closed and balanced out with a \"Pick Up\" entry. All services relevant to equipment rental should therefore be assigned a corresponding equipment type. For more information on this, see the \"Equipment Movements\" documentation. Checking the Blocked box will block services for operational usage. Blocked services can no longer be validated in the documents, i.e. the sales quotes, contracts, and sales orders. There is one thing to remember, though: If the service has already been saved in a contract line before being blocked, any number of new sales orders or order lines can be generated from this contract line despite the block. To prevent this from happening, go to Waste Management Setup under the Contract tab and check the Block Contracts w. Cust. /Vend. box. This will prevent blocked services from repeatedly being copied over from contracts to sales orders. Register Invoicing The main fields under the Invoicing register are shown below: Checking the Do Not Invoice box will prevent the order lines from being included in combine invoicing. This is useful for services that are shown on the customer's invoice, such as the use of certain special vehicles, equipment or employees, but that are not billed separately. When services whose Do Not Invoice box is checked are validated in document lines, the document Invoice field is set to \"No\". Up to 3 characters can normally be entered into the On Hold field of a service, e.g. the initials of the employee, in order to temporarily prevent newly created order lines with this service. The service can still be used for operational purposes, but order lines with this service will be ignored when combine invoicing. This makes it possible to temporarily block services from invoicing and, when needed, release them for invoicing again. The Gen. Prod. Posting Group and VAT Class fields are used to manage the posting of sales and purchase prices and the associated VAT to the corresponding general ledger accounts. See the standard training materials from MS Business Central to find out the significance of and how to set up these posting groups. In regard to enwis it is only important that the posting groups in the service card represent real posting groups that actually manage the posting of revenues and costs in the G/L accounts. Unlike a lot of the master data in enwis (e.g. equipment), where the system routinely prompts the users to enter the posting groups, the posting groups on the services card are the central element that links the operating business to the general ledger accounts. There are no restrictions on the codes entered in the Sales Delivery Code and Purch. Delivery Code fields. It is up to the users whether and how delivery codes are used in the daily business of creating and processing sales orders. Note, however, that delivery codes may be used as a pricing criterion. It is sufficient to record the corresponding delivery code in the order line and then save a price in the Service Prices table for both combinations. It only makes sense to save these in the service card if specific services are constantly being linked to specific delivery codes in the real business processes. Units of measurement that are typically used for measuring the invoiced quantities but that differ from the base unit of measure code can be saved in the Sales Unit of Measure Code and Purch. Unit of Measure Code fields. If invoicing is normally done using the unit of \"Piece\" but the stock is usually kept in the unit \"Ton\", then \"Ton\" is defined as the base unit of measurement for the service, while \"Piece\" is saved as the purchasing or sales unit of measurement. A conversion code between the two units of measurement can be linked to the service. The same applies for the Sales Rental Invoice UOM and Purch. Rental Invoice UOM fields, which are mainly used for rental services. It makes sense to use \"Day\" as the base unit of measure for rental invoices, though leased equipment might be invoiced in hours, days, weeks, or months. These various time units can be saved in a rental service just like the conversion code, which sets the conversion between the invoicing unit of measurement and the base unit of measurement. The Cycle Code field can be used for cyclic document creation. Cyclic Document creation allows recurring sales orders to be automatically created from contracts. If there is a set relationship between a service and its regular performance, it makes sense to save a cycle code directly in the service so that it can be copied over automatically when the service is validated in the contract lines. For more information on this, see the \"Cyclic Document Creation Setup\" documentation. In the Concept No. field, a service can be linked with a concept, so that the concept is copied over when the service is validated in the documents. When business transactions involve multiple business partners, concepts in enwis serve to allocate the service quantities, costs, and revenues among the partners involved. For more information on this, see the \"Concepts\" documentation. The Cost Center Code and Cost Object Code fields can be used to associate the service with cost centers and cost objects that will be copied when the services are validated in the documents. Cost centers and cost objects are dimensions in MS Business Central and there setup is described in the corresponding standard training documentation. Register Handling The main fields under the Handling register are shown below: The Transfer Description 2 field on the service card manages whether the content in the Description 2 field on the service card will be copied to a document line or not. The following options are available: Always The content in the Description 2 field of the service will always be copied to the document line. If Empty The content in the Description 2 field of the service will only be copied to the document line if the Description 2 field in the document line is not yet filled. If a service is validated in an empty document line, then the content from the Description 2 field will be copied over. If another service is then validated in the same line, the content of its Description 2 field will not be copied as long as the option \"If Empty\" has been saved in its Transfer Description 2 field. Never The content in the Description 2 field will never be copied from the service to the document line. The content in the Description 2 field of the document line will never be filled with the content from the current service. Use the Dispatch for Weighbridge field on the service card to manage how the system should behave in the Weighbridge Dispatching field of the document line when the service is validated. Only order lines with a Weighbridge Dispatching field set to \"Weigh\" will be made available to the weighing operator as a sales order to be weighed. The individual options in the Dispatch For Weighbridge field on the service card manages whether the \"Weigh\" option is set in only customers' order lines, only vendors' order lines or both when the corresponding service is validated. Register Foreign Trade The main fields under the Export register are shown below: The Tariff No. , Country of Origin Code , and Net Weight fields on the service card were copied by enwis from the default item card in MS Business Central. These fields are relevant for customs declarations in the Export department. See the corresponding training documentation from MS Business Central for more information about their use. Register Indexing The main fields under the Keywords register are show below: The Keywords tab offers the option of saving a keyword catalog for each service describing the main characteristics of that service. Using this list of keywords, all services can then be filtered to show only those that meet specific characteristics, e.g. all services with a certain waste material, or a combination of specific characteristics."

  "documentation/Service/ServiceChartOfAccounts.html": {
    "href": "documentation/Service/ServiceChartOfAccounts.html",
    "title": "Service Chart of Accounts | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Service Chart of Accounts General Information The service charge of accounts gives an overview of the invoice amounts and associated revenues and purchase prices as they relate to the services. The service chart of accounts is automatically filled by enwis when creating an invoice. The service chart of accounts draws its information from the invoice ledger entries. The quantities that move through the Sales (Qty.) and Purchases (Qty.) fields of the chart are not related to the operational quantities in the sales orders but rather the invoice quantities recorded in the Quantity field in the order lines. Therefore, the service chart of accounts is also not updated when a sales order is released. When a sales order is released, only the operational quantities recorded in each line entry are posted. For example, when a sales order with a waste entry is released, the system creates a waste ledger entry that is immediately visible as a change in the waste chart of accounts. In contrast, only the invoice ledger entries, which are not made until an invoice is created, e.g. as part of combine invoicing, are relevant to the service chart of accounts. Setup The accounts in the chart are nothing more than the services that are defined by going to Services . When users click on the Card icon in the service chart of accounts, they are therefore brought to the service card. The service chart of accounts need not be set up separately; it is created and updated automatically in the background by enwis when the services are defined. Each service is simultaneously set up as an account in the service chart of accounts, which quantity and value transactions can be posted to. In addition, there is an option to structure the service chart of accounts by adding headers and subtotals. If this is desired, then users must set up the corresponding \"dummy services\", which will not be recorded in the sales orders; they serve no other purpose than to make the service chart of accounts easier to read. The function of a service in the Service Chart of Accounts is defined in the Account Type field on the service card , which can only be edited from the chart of accounts. The following options are available: Posting The chart of accounts reads the service as a postable account. Heading The chart of accounts only uses the service as a header. Begin-Total / End-Total The chart of accounts will use the service as a general account where the value of the other accounts will be totaled. Which accounts will be included in the total must be manually set in the Totaling field of the service chart of accounts. From Sum / To Sum | From and To Sums have a similar function. All accounts placed between the From Sum account and To Sum account will automatically be totaled in the To Sum account. Use the Chart of Accounts Indentation function to indent all of the accounts placed between the From Sum account and the To Sum account. Their corresponding service or account numbers will be copied to the Totaling field of the service chart of accounts. By doing so, users do not have to manually indicate which accounts should be included in the total. At the same time, there is a visual presentation of which accounts are included in the total because they are indented."

    "href": "documentation/Service/ServiceProvisionSelection.html",
    "title": "Service Provision Selection | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Service Provision Selection General Information enwis offers the option of setting up a service provision matrix that lists which business partners can provide which services and which business partners your company can provide which services to. The selection parameters include the service group, the service, the region, and the starting date. Using this logic, users can select a vendor with its task site, a customer with its task site, a vehicle, and if necessary, a different vendor or customer for the invoices. This selection allows users to modify either the posting (e.g. Post-with No. field in the document line) or the balance account (e.g. Bal. Acc. Post-with No. field in the document line). Default Settings The service provision matrix can be addressed manually from the creator's sales quotes, contracts, and sales orders, and automatically via QuickDoc , as well as by calling up programming functions such as status change and release code units. Before working with the service provision matrix, it is necessary to put certain default settings in place in Dispatching Setup under the Service tab. The selection of service providers can be associated with a region code. The Region Type Service Provision field determines which type of region code is involved. The following options are available: Dispatching Group Area Territory Postal Code Local Auth. Key Note The region type must be selected before anything can be entered into the service provision matrix and once there are lines in the service provision matrix, the region type can no longer be changed. The Service Provision Scope field defines whether the service provision matrix will mainly be used to determine the source of a service performed for the company (normally from a vendor), the potential target of a service performed by the company (normally a customer), or both. The corresponding options are called: Complete Source Performance The Multiple Service Prov. Lines field defines whether it is possible for more than one service provider to perform the same service (or service group) in the same region at the same time. When selecting manually (e.g. from the sales order), all service providers saved in the system will be shown in this case. When selecting automatically (e.g. via QuickDoc or status change or release code units), only one service provider will be recognized and that will be the last one that meets all of the criteria equally. The Apply Service Provision to field defines the fields in the document line where the service provision selection should occur. However, the value in this optional field is only a default setting for the manual service provision selection in the sales quote, contract, or sales order. It will be overridden by any value in the field with the same name in the Service Provision Selection form. Automatic service provision selection via QuickDoc always copies the value in the balance account (exception: business type = transport). When a function is called up directly from a programming code, the parameter has to be defined regarding which field in the selected service provider should be activated. This logic is illustrated once again in the following overview: Called Up Via Business Type Matrix Copy To Document Vendor/Customer Depends upon setting in selection form (pre-set during setup) Posting Type, Post-with No., Task-at Code, Inv. with No. Bal. Acc. Posting Type, Bal. Acc. Post-with No., Bal. Acc. Task Site, Bal. Acc. Invoice-with No. Document | Vehicle | Vehicle No. QuickDoc | Vendor/Customer | Bal. Acc. Posting Type, Bal. Acc.

Posting Type, Bal. Acc. Post-with No., Bal. Acc. Task Site, Bal. Acc. Invoice-with No. Programming Code | Vehicle | Vehicle No. Setting Up a Service Provision Matrix The Service Provision Matrix can be called by going to enwis Order Processing Setup Service Provision Matrix. The service provision matrix controls which vendor and which vehicle can be deployed in which region for a specific service, and which customer the company provides its own services to. The criteria for selecting the business partner are defined in the Service Group , Service No. , Region Code , Service Provision Type , and Start Date fields. It is not necessary to meet all of these criteria in each line. Users could, for example, only work with the service groups or only with the service groups and region codes, or use different criteria where they are needed. The lines in the service provision matrix normally contain a service group, even if it has not be explicitly displayed. Each line is assigned to the most recently displayed service group, shown in bold. For reasons of clarity, the service group is not shown on each line; rather the lines are grouped together. This requires that a Service Group Code be assigned to the service in the field of the same name. The service parameters (service group, region code, etc.) are assigned to the corresponding service providers using the Business Type , Business Partner , Business Partner Site , and Invoice Code fields: The business type \"Vendor\" can be assigned to a vendor and its order address The business type \"Customer\" can be assigned to a customer and its task site The business type \"Vehicle\" can be assigned to an internal vehicle to be selected for the performance of a service Service Provision Selection in the Document Manual service provision selection can be called up in the document lines by going to Actions (Alt + F10) Line Service Provision Selection . Note When a service has been assigned to a service group, this does not need to be entered manually. The service group is automatically copied over with the service. The service provision selection is filtered by the service group, the service number, and the task date on the document line, as well as the dispatching group code of the task site or order address or of the vendor or customer on the document line (or the document header if there is one). Users can select the right service provider and copy its corresponding information into the posting or balance account fields in the document line. Where the information is copied to is controlled by the Apply Service Provision to field (see point 2 under the Default Settings for more information). Users can apply the Service Provision Type Filter criteria to limit the choice of services. When the selection is confirmed by clicking on \"OK\", enwis copies the source to the Bal. Acc. Post-with No. field and, if appropriate, to the Bal. Acc. Task Site field. Automatic Service Provision Selection via QuickDoc When creating documents in QuickDoc , service provision selection can be executed automatically in the background. This function is activated in the Find Service Provider field under the Contract tab of the Dispatching Code Card . Go to enwis Workflow/Administration/Dispatching Codes to call up dispatching codes. The following options are available: Option Description Never No automatic service provision selection occurs. On Upload Automatic service provision selection is initiated when loading QuickDoc (i.e., before showing the record). On Write Back Automatic service provision selection is initiated when clicking on OK to leave QuickDoc (and create the document). Always Automatic service provision selection is initiated both when loading and when leaving QuickDoc. Automatic service provision selection within the scope of QuickDoc basically only copies your results to the Bal. Acc. fields and the Vehicle No. field (depending on the business type). For more information on this topic, see point 2 under Default Settings. IMPORTANT: Automatic Service Provision Selection via QuickDoc can only occur if the type of document line is Service, when there is a Service No., and when the Post-with No. field is filled. If a sales order is created using QuickDoc based on a task site, the balance account fields are automatically filled. If the selected task site is labeled with a dispatching group code, enwis will decide the service provider responsible for this region and that also meets the other selection criteria. The following Service Provision Selection form illustrates this relationship. Note If multiple service providers meet the service criteria (see Multiple Service Prov. Lines field in Dispatching Setup (see point 2 under Default Settings), automatic service provision selection selects the last service provider."

    "keywords": "Tours & Tour Plans A tour usually is a number of individual orders that are processed on the same day by the same driver with the same vehicle without returning in between to the starting point. The operative use of the tour logic starts with the creation of a tour plan. In the current version of enwis, A tour plan shall always be created in combination with cyclic documents. In case if there is no pre-defined cycle codes for creating cyclic documents in combination with tours and for instance, if an On-Demand tour should be created even this is possible with the current functionality.

For Example, In the scope of cyclic document generation a shared tour is generated for all order lines that have the same usage date and that are assigned to the same tour plan. These order lines are then automatically assigned to this tour."

For instance, It is possible to assign one or more transport groups to a service in question using the bill of resources. These Transport groups in the bill of resources are transferred to transport entries in the documents when exploded. It makes most sense to save the transport groups in a service bill of resources for all services that are regularly associated with a transport entry in the documents. Similar to the transport groups personnel groups are associated with Personal entries and tools with tool entries."

    "title": "Waste Management Setup | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Waste management set up Introduction In enwis there are various set ups with which the programme behaviour is controlled at central points. These are: Waste management setup) Dispatching set up Invoice setup Concept set up Commitments setup Weighbridge setup Analytics setup Treatment setup Waste document setup Operational journal setup Data warehouse setup Of these the waste management setup is the most important. The fundamental enwis® functions are parametrised via this. The waste management set up can be called up by the following menu path enwis services/Administation/setup/waste management setup for example. Their registers and fields are described individually below. General register On the register general it possible to meet the following settings: Allow Posting From / Allow Posting To Here the data can be entered from or up to the postings for the area of the waste management ledger entries, equipment ledger entries, transport ledger entries and personnel ledger entries permitted by enwis®. If the posting time periods are not restricted in enwis, the posting time periods of the general ledger apply. Posting time periods can be consigned at various points in enwis. The hierarchy is as follows: Waste management setup user Waste management setup User setup General ledger setup <!-- --> credit warnings Here you can determine whether the application is to display a warning message about the status of the customer on creation of customer waste management orders or invoices or customer lines in waste management orders. The following options are available: Both Warnings If this option is used the application checks the fields Credit Limit and Overdue Balance on the customer card and issues a warning message if the customer has exceeded his credit limit or is in arrears with payment. Credit Limit If this option is used, the application compares the value in the field Credit Limit of the customer card with the balance of the customer and issues a warning message if the balance of the customer exceeds this amount. Overdue Balance If this option is used, the application checks the field Overdue Balance on the customer card and issues a warning message if the customer is in arrears with payment. No warning If you select this option the application does not issue any warning messages on the status of the customer. Stockout Warning Here it is possible to determine whether the application is to issue a warning message as soon as the warehouse outflow would lead to a negative inventory. The application uses all posted waste ledger entries as a basis of the calculation in addition to the waste entries which have already been created but not yet posted with the entry type \"Disposal\". In order to receive a warning message as soon as the inventory becomes negative, it is necessary to place a tick in the field Stockout Warning. Allow Cust. / Vend. Changeover Here it is possible to determine whether the functionality of the customer/vendor jumping is in principle allowed or not. If this functionality is in principle to be allowed, a tick must be placed in the field Allow Cust./Vend . Changeover . If this field does not show a tick, then customer/vendor jumping is not possible in the application regardless of all other relevant settings. Transfer Bal. Acc. Only Once Here it is possible to specify that a counter posting line is only generated from an order line once. Via the functions Create Bal- Acc. Lines or Create Bal- Acc. Line the corresponding counter lines are generated in the order by the application for the existing order lines which have an entry in the field Bal. Acc. Post-with No.. If this function is applied, it is written back in all order lines from which counter lines are generated that corresponding counter lines have already been generated. For this purpose the fields Bal. Account Line Exploded and Belongs to Bal. Acc. Line are filled in the original line. If the field Transfer Bal. Acc. Only Once is ticked, counter posting lines are not generated once again from order lines from which counter posting lines were already generated. If the field is not ticked, counter posting lines are generated every time, double or triple where appropriate. If the function delete all bal. acc. lines or delete bal. acc. line is called, the entries in the fields Bal. Account Line Exploded and Belongs to Bal. Acc. Line are also reset so that these order lines would once again be taken into account for a recent development. Write Back Balande Account In this field it is possible to specify that the content of the field Post-with No. of the original line is transferred into the field Bal. Acc. Post-with No. of the counter posting line which has emerged from it. In addition, if this field is ticked, for a manual change of the Post-with No. in the counter posting line generated, this is written back into the field Bal. Acc. Post-with No. the original line, meaning: The field Bal. Acc. Post-with No. of the original line is synchronised with changes in the field Post-with No. of the counter posting line which has emerged from it. Global Delivery Codes Delivery codes can be used either globally, i.e. for all customer and vendors equally or locally i.e. limited to individual customers and vendors. If this field is ticked all delivery codes are available globally. If this field is not ticked, only the delivery codes consigned for each customer or vendor are available. Global order codes Order codes can be used either globally, i.e. for all customers and vendors equally or locally i.e. limited to individual customers and vendors. If this field is ticked, all order codes are available globally. If this field is not ticked, only the order codes consigned for each customer or vendor are available. Keep Quotes In this field it is possible to specify that quotes are not to be deleted automatically if an order is created from them via the function create Order . Keep Task Date In this field it is possible to specify that the task date of the order lines is not to be changed if the task date is changed in the order header. Ext. Texts Date Here it is possible to specify the date to which the application is to refer when inserting one of the text components provided with a start date. The following options are available Document Date The application refers to the document date Order Date The application refers to the order date Task Date The application refers to the task date The standard of MS Business Central always refers to the document date. Reference Nos. Start Here it is possible to consign a general starting point for the establishment of entry numbers via the function Create Refernece List Nos. If a value 10000 is consigned here for example then the first entry number established in a document by the function Create Refernece List Nos . receives the value 10000, the second the value 10001 etc. Quote to Document function Here the ID can have a code unit consigned which is additionally to be realised via the functions create Order or create Contract of the quote document when creating a document from a quote. Quote to Doc. Function Name In this field the name of a code unit selected in the field Quote to Document function is displayed. The field cannot be changed by the user. Check operative data on delete When deleting order lines, a large number of operational data are also deleted if appropriate which are linked with this order line (e.g. waste entries, equipment entries, weighbridge ticket number, waste transfer note). If this field is ticked, a warning message is displayed before deletion which reminds the user that the application of a new order line may involve doing more than assigning a service number. The function checks the presence of certain data such as waste entry and issues a corresponding collection warning message. Service Qty. Transfer Via the function transfer quantity it is possible to transfer the invoice quantity (= field Quantity ) in the order from the first service line to further service lines. The legalities according to which this can occur can be specified via the field Service Qty. Transfer. The following options are available: No Transfer Invoice quantities are in principle not transferred even if this function is called up explicitly from the order. If Empty The invoice quantity is transferred into all order lines which show the value 0 in the field Q uantity . Service No. The invoice quantity is transferred into all order lines with the same service number. Service Level The invoice quantity is transferred into all order lines, the service of which belongs to the same service level. Service Type The invoice quantity is transferred into all order lines, the service of which belongs to the same service type. Implement Site Logic Here it is possible to specify whether the site logic is to be taken into account. If the site logic is taken into consideration, this has the following consequences for example: The transport entries of the transport dispatching are filtered on calling up via the site of the user if a site is allocated to it in the User setup When posting the waste ledger entries and equipment ledger entries, a check takes place regarding whether the site code of the entry matches the user's site code, if a site is assigned to the user in the User setup and the change of site is not permitted. In this case posting can only occur for matching site codes If the field Implement Site Logic is not ticked, these tests or filterings remain undone. Post Line Site Codes (post site of the line) The site code in the document header can differ from that of the document line. This can be the case for example if a combine invoice was created with lines from several sites. The invoice header then contains the site of the user who has created the combine invoice. The document lines contain the sites which have performed the operational service. If this field is ticked, all resultant ledger entries are posted with the site of the relevant document line. If this field is not ticked, all resultant ledger entries are posted with the site of the document header. Allow site logic for quotes Here it can be specified whether quotes are filtered onto the site which the current user belongs to. The following options are available: Blank Quotes are not filtered by site Purchase Only vendor quotes are filtered by site Sale Only customer quotes are filtered by site Both All quotes are filtered by site Allow site logic for contract Here it can be specified whether contracts are filtered onto the site which the current user belongs to. The following options are available: Blank Contracts are not filtered by site Purchase Only vendor contracts are filtered by site Sale Only customer contracts are filtered by site Both All contracts are filtered by site Allow site logic for order Here it can be specified whether orders are filtered onto the site which the current user belongs to. The following options are available: Blank Orders are not filtered by site Purchase Only vendor orders are filtered by site Sale Only customer orders are filtered by site Both All orders are filtered by site Allow site logic for tours Here it can be specified whether tours and tour plans are filtered onto the site which the current user belongs to. Log User on Doc. Comments Here you can specify whether the user ID of the current user is to be written back into the document comment when creating and modifying document comments. If this field is ticked, the field Eingefügt von (inserted by) is filled with the user ID of the current user when applying the observation line; on changing the field Last Modified by is filled in. These recording functions are limited to comments in documents which have not been posted or archived, thus only of interest to long term contracts. Register Numbering On the register Numberierung it possible to meet the following settings: Service Nos. Here the code of the number series is entered which is to be used in order to allocate numbers to services. Job Nos. Here the code of the number series is entered which is to be used in order to allocate numbers to waste management projects. Business Partner Nos. Here the code of the number series is entered which is to be used in order to allocate numbers to business partners. Business Partner Site Nos. Here the code of the number series is entered which is to be used in order to allocate numbers to business partner sites. Cust. Task Site Nos.

Here the code of the number series is entered which is to be used in order to allocate numbers to vendor task sites. Base Vend. Task Site Nos. Here the code of the number series is entered which is to be used in order to allocate numbers to vendor base task sites. Cust. /Vend. No. is Base Site If this field is ticked, the customer number or vendor number is set as the number of the customer base task site or vendor base task site. Autom. Vend.-No. Assgnm. This field controls the allocation of the vendor number if an associated creditor is generated automatically from the customer card via the function create vendor . The following options are available: Blank | The automatic application of vendors via the function create vendor from the customer card is not possible. --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Vend. Nos. | The next free number from the number series consigned to the field vendor numbers in the vendor and purchase set up is allocated to the vendor. Cust. Nos. plus | The customer number which the code is placed in front of which is consigned in the field Vend.-No.Prefix of the waste management setup is set as vendor number. Example: The customer number is D4711; the code K is consigned in the field Vend.-No.Prefix ; the resultant vendor number is KD4711. Numeric Pas | The numeric proportion of the customer number which the code is placed in front of which is consigned in the field Vend.-No.Prefix of the waste management set up is set as vendor number. Example: The customer number is D4711; the code K is consigned in the field Vend.-No.Prefix ; the resultant vendor number is K4711. Vend.-No. Prefix Here a code can be consigned which is placed in front of the vendor number if the vendor is generated automatically via the function Create vendor from the customer card . The code is accessed if the field Autom. Vend.-No. Assgnm. in the waste management setup shows the option value \"Cust. Nos. plu \"or \"Numeric Pad\". Autom. Cust.-No. Assgnm. In line with the field Autom. Vend.-No. Assgnm. Cust.-No. Prefix In line with the field Vend.-No. Prefix Haz.-mat Type Nos. Here the code of the number series is entered which is to be used in order to allocate numbers to hazardous material types. Global Int. Mat.-Catalog Nos. Here the code of the number series is entered which is to be used in order to allocate numbers to the internal material catalog. Ext. Material Catalog Nos. Here the code of the number series is entered which is to be used in order to allocate numbers to EWC materials. Notification Nos. Here the code of the number series is entered which is to be used in order to allocate notification numbers. Official Notification Nos. Here the code of the number series is entered which is to be used in order to allocate official notification numbers. An internal notification number must be assigned to each notification. Corresponding number series can be consigned via the field Notification Nos . Many disposal enterprises are also able to issue official notification numbers. For these cases a number series can also be consigned for these via the field Official Notification No. . Waste Mgt. Employee Nos. Here the code of the number series is entered which is to be used in order to allocate waste management employee numbers. Vehicle Nos. Here the code of the number series is entered which is to be used in order to allocate vehicle numbers. Personnel Group Nos. Here the code of the number series is entered which is to be used in order to allocate personnel group numbers. Equipment Nos. Here the code of the number series is entered which is to be used in order to allocate equipment numbers. Transport Group Nos. Here the code of the number series is entered which is to be used in order to allocate transport group numbers. External Document No. Nos. Here a global number series for external document numbers can be consigned. Cust. /Vend. Ext. Doc. No. Nos The number series set up in the field External Document No. Nos. can then be consigned by customer/vendor if the field Cust. /Vend. Ext. Doc. No. Nos . has a tick placed in it. Tour Plan Nos. Here the code of the number series is entered which is to be used in order to allocate tour plan numbers. Tour Nos. Here the code of the number series is entered which is to be used in order to allocate tour numbers. Register Archive On the register Archive it is possible to meet the following settings: Print Multi-Reports Separately If this field is ticked, a request form opens before each print out. This function gives the user the possibility of selecting a printer manually for each individual report via \"Setting Page\" or to change the default print parameters instead of printing in the side view. Multi-Reports incl. Rep. Type The multi-report function takes the consigned report types into account. It is possible to consign a report (or a series of several reports) for each combination from intended use (quote, contract, order), posting type, business flow, customer, customer task site, business relationship type and report type code. This means that the simultaneous print out of multiple reports for a widest range of purposes (order confirmation, haulage display, customer registration etc.) can be fully automated. The establishment of the report to be selected thereby occurs in line with the pricing. This means: A report does not need to be consigned for each combination; all fields of the report selection are searched through for the current value of the order line to be printed in this field or an empty value. Archive Contract Via the field Archive Contact it is possible to specify that a copy is placed in the archive on automatic deletion of contracts. Contracts are in addition to posted invoices and credit memos - the only documents which are continuously present in the system outside the archive. Contracts do not disappear like orders for example. They remain permanently unless they are deleted. Archive Order Via the field Archive Order it is possible to stipulate that a copy of the order is archived when it is cleared. On clearance the order is converted into a completed order. If no tick is placed in the field Archive Order then it disappears out of the system. If the field is ticked, an archived version emerges on clearance. If the clearance of the completed order is retracted and the order which is again available is posted once again, a second version of the order is transferred into the archive. Archive Quote This option field can be used to control how enwis is to proceed with regard to the archiving of quotes. The following options are available: Never Quotes are in principle not archived. On Confirmation Quotes are archived if the user confirms the corresponding dialogue window with \"Yes\". Always Quotes are in principle archived. Arch. Contr. On Manual Delete Via the field Arch. Contr. On Manual Delete it is possible to specify whether enwis should archive a contract when deleting it manually. Arch. Order On Manual Delete Via the field Arch. Order on Manuel Delete it is possible to specify whether enwis should archive an order when deleting it manually. Arch. Code On Manuel Delete Here it is possible to consign a code which is transferred into the archived document on manual deletion of a document. Archive Invoice / Credit Memo The two fields Archive Invoice and Archive Credit Memo refer to the unposted version of both document types. It is urgently advised that a tick is placed in both fields! It is only when unposted invoices and credit memos are archived that the enwis comfort cancellation functions which support the user in the value and quantity cancellation can be used. Therefore enwis accesses the archive version of the underlying unposted document for the cancellation of posted documents. These unposted documents are the final station in which all data are completely present in the form of the order line from enwis. When posting, splitting occurs into the invoice entries of enwis and the invoice or credit memo line of MS Business Central which is clearly reduced in information content. Copy Comments Contr. to Order Via the field Copy Comments Contr. to Order it is possible to specify whether observations consigned in the contract header and the contract lines are transferred into the order. Any comments can be consigned in the contract header and the contract lines independent of one another. These are only transferred into the order created from the contract if the field Copy Comments Contr. to Order is ticked. Copy Document Via the field Copy Document it is possible to control the copying function for the creation of orders from documents which are already present. The following options can be selected: Standard A dialogue window is opened in which it is necessary to select which type of documents or archived documents are to be used as a copying template for the creation of a new document. Orders The overview of the orders opens. An order can be selected which is to be used as a copying template. Order Archive The overview of the archived orders opens. An archived order can be selected which is to be used as a copying template. Create History for Contract If the field Create History for Contract is ticked, this is automatically written into the document history of the contract on the creation of a contract from a quote. The tracking of the document history is only possible for waste transfer notes, quotes and contracts. With this function it is clear which documents have \"historically\" led to other documents. If a tick is placed in the field Create History for Contract , a document history is created from a quote on each creation of a contract, via which it is clear from which quote the contract has emerged. Register Prices On the register prices it is possible to meet the following settings: Order Pricing by It can be specified which daily data present in the document are to be taken into account in the pricing. In the pricing enwis goes back to the service price table. Prices which are consigned there can be provided with a start date and an end date where appropriate. In the field Order Pricing by both the options \"Order Date\" and \"Task Date\" are available. Here the option \"Task Date\" should be selected. Contract Pricing by It can be specified which daily data present in the document are to be taken into account in the pricing. In the pricing enwis goes back to the service price table. Prices which are consigned there can be provided with a start date and an end date where appropriate. In the field Preisfindung im Auftrag nach the options \"Posting Date\", \"Work Date\" and \"Actual Date\" are available. Here the option \"Work Date\" or \"Actual Date\" should be selected. Invoice Pricing by It can be specified which daily data present in the document are to be taken into account in the pricing. In the pricing enwis goes back to the service price table. Prices which are consigned there can be provided with a start date and an end date where appropriate. In the field Contract Pricing by nach both the options \"Posting Date\" and \"Task Date\" are available. Here the option \"Task Date\" should be selected. Create Price Grp. w. Contract If this field is ticked an identical price group for the contract is created. Auto-Create Cust. Price Group If the field Auto-Create Cust. Price Group is ticked, a new price group is applied automatically on creation of a new customer. In this way each customer automatically receives an individual price code which makes it possible to differentiate prices customer specifically. Auto-Create Task Site Pr. Group The option field Auto-Create Task Site Pr.Group. has an analogous function. It contains the following options: Blank Task Site Customer + Task Site If prices are not to be differentiated according to customer task sites, it is necessary to select the option \" \". If prices are to be set up customer task site specifically, one of the other two options must be selected. If the option \"Task Site\" is selected, the customer task site code is applied as price group at the same time in order to reach a customer task site specific pricing. On selection of the option \"Customer + Task Site\" a price group from the combination of customer number and customer task site code is applied. Note It must be ensured that the price group code has a maximum of ten digits. Customer number and customer task site code are thus allowed a maximum of ten characters!** Sep. f. Task Site Price Group The field Sep. f. Task Site Price Group refers to the previously mentioned possibility of the price group definition for customer task sites. If the price group code is to be made up of the customer number and customer task site code, a single separating character (e.g. \"+\", \"#\" or \"-\") can be consigned in this field which separates the two components of the combined price group code from one another. Auto-Create Vend. Price Group If the field Auto-Create Vend. Price Group is ticked, a new price group is applied automatically on creation of a new vendor. In this way each vendor automatically receives an individual price code which makes it possible to differentiate prices vendor specifically. Do Not Invoice Vendors If a tick is placed in the field Do Not Inovice Vendors , vendor lines are in principle not invoiced. No invoices or credit memos are thus in principle generated from them. The field Invoice is automatically set to the value \"Nein\" in the vendor document lines. Purch. On Hold Here it is possible to enter a maximum three digit code which is then written into each vendor order line in the field On Hold as standard. This is excluded from the invoice as long as this digit code is present in the line. In principle all vendor lines are thus also excluded from the invoicing. There is however the possibility of removing the Abwarten code from the lines later on so that they can be invoiced. Recalculate price The field Recalculate price controls when the last valid access to the service price table occurs. It has the following options: Never The recourse only occurs during the order application, however on a multiple basis, if price forming criteria are entered, added or changed. In this way enwis does in principle go back to the service price table once again on changes to the service or quantity. Release Within the framework of the clearance enwis does once again extract the valid service price from the service price table while taking all price relevant criteria in the order line into account. The document date which enwis should take into consideration in the temporal demarcation of individual service prices can be specified via the field Order Pircing by in the waste management setup. Combine Invoice The same applies analogously for the option \"Combine Invoice\". However this option refers to the next higher stage in the processing of the documents. If price relevant changes are still made in the completed order, these are taken into account in the combine invoice if the option \"Combine Invoice\" is ticked in the Recalculate Price. Always Similarly the option \"always\" extends the possibilities for retrospective entry of price relevant changes. For the option \"Immer\" changes are taken into account in the unposted documents and in the final pricing if these documents are finally posted. Here the point in time of the definitive access to the service price table is dependent on the settings in the field Invoice Pricing by. Grad. Price Relation (Default) The field Graduated Price Relation is used to define which entries the establishment of the quantities refers to on consideration of accumulated quantities. The following options are available in the field Mengenstaffelbezug: Waste Material Service On selection of the option \"Waste Material\", the accumulated quantities from the field Waste Material Code of the order line and the associated waste ledger entries are formed. This option makes sense if there is a 1:1 connection between service and waste material. The waste code can be allocated on the service card. On selection of the option \"Sevice\" the accumulated quantities from the field No. of the order line and the associated waste ledger entries are formed. Split Graduate Price The field Split Gradute Price controls the handling of the enwis quantity graduation function. Each service price can be differentiated by quantity via quantity graduations. Example: 0 to 5 to: 35 € / to 6 to 15 to: 30 € / to 16 to 30 to: 27.50 € / to Quantity splitting means that the price is made up from these differentiated graduated prices and that these are also shown differentiated. The quantity splitting can occur manually from the order and the unposted invoice or automatically with the combine invoice. Two pre-requisites apply for this: Each service price line for which quantity splitting is to occur must have a tick in the field Split Graduate Price . In addition the field Split Graduate Price must be set up in the waste management setup . The following options are available here: Never In principle no quantity splitting occurs. Even if the field Mengenstaffel splitten was ticked in the service price line. Manual Quantity splitting can only be triggered out of the document manually. Optional Quantity splitting can be triggered manually and it is additionally carried out manually in the combine invoice if it is set up in such a way in the corresponding order line. Check Bottom Price The field Check Bottom Price makes it possible to set up a balance between defined lower price limits and current invoice prices as a standard work flow. For this purpose it is necessary to define a minimum price in the field Bottom Price in the service price list . If the waste management setup also has the field Check Bottom Price ticked, enwis compares whether the sales price entered on the order line goes below the lower price limit. In this case an error message is issued and the order line cannot be posted. Note This balance does not occur within the framework of the document processing and it only occurs on posting the invoice. Consider Ending Date The field Consider Ending Date refers to end dates which can be consigned in the service price table. The temporal differentiation of valid prices normally occurs exclusively via the start date. Example: The price of 9.50 € for the construction waste service runs out from 01.08.2013 when a new price of 11.15 € is available from this start state. An end date which is placed in the service price table is however only taken into consideration if the field Consider Ending Date is ticked. Then enwis will no longer find this service price after the end date. Price Tr. excl. Starting Date If the function edit price by criteria is called up, the start date is optionally ignored for filtering. Start Price Editing Adjusted The criteria with which the dialogue \"Change Service Price\" is opened can be controlled in the Waste Management Setup on the register Preise via the option field Start Price Editing Adjusted . The options are: Never On service price On rental price Always In principle it is possible to make a distinction between two types of presentation here: the start with an adapted or non-adapted price line - this can still be differentiated to the effect that the user displays a service price or a rental price. If the price processing is not adapted as it is started, the function Preis über Kriterien bearbeiten is filled with all price relevant criteria which are located on the document line from which the function is called up. If the function edit price by criteria is started with adapted price processing, pricing is put in ahead which aims to find an existing more general service price line which meets as many of the criteria input on the document line as possible. Confine Price Criteria If the field confine Price Criteria is ticked then this has direct effects on the possibility of price maintenance and the display of the price criteria. In the service price list in which the master data of the services are maintained, only the price criteria which have not been deactivated are shown automatically. The deactivated price criteria on the other hand are blocked out. They can be shown by the user but they are still deactivated and they cannot be processed. The deactivated price criteria are then also not available in these price overviews and views of the operational area. The dialogue edit price by criteria for example does in principle only show those price criteria which are not deactivated. All deactivated price criteria are not displayed and they cannot be shown either. Register Dimensions On the register Dimensions it is possible to meet the following settings: No Transfer of Dims.to Docs. If a tick is placed in the field No Transfer of Dims. to Docs.** ,** dimension values are not written into the documents at all and are instead only established following generation of the posted invoice from the master data and allocated to the entries which emerge on posting. This process has two great advantages: The performance of the database is increased as the dimension values do not have to be incorporated through all documents Users are not tempted to \"correct\" the dimension values of the documents. Instead the master data appear as the correct place for the maintenance of dimension values <!-- --> Manually Set Doc. Line Dimensions The field Manually Set Doc. Line Dimensions controls the transfer of dimension values from the master data into the documents. In MS Business Central Standard all document line dimensions are in principle deleted and newly established as soon as a field of the sales or purchase line is validated from the master data of which guideline dimensions can be taken. In enwis the field Manually Set Doc. Line Dimensions can be used to control this programme behaviour. The following three options are available: Refresh all enwis behaves like standard Navision. Whenever a field of the waste management line is validated from the master data of which guideline dimensions are taken, all document line dimensions of this line are deleted and newly structured. Keep Addes Dims. Only dimensions extracted from master data are deleted and newly established. Additionally manually input dimensions remain (but not just manually changed dimension values or dimensions which were taken from master data; these values are newly calculated and the manually made changes are overwritten.). Change current only Only the dimensions which are taken from the master data of the currently changed document line field are deleted and newly established. All other dimensions are retained without any changes. Not Transfer of Dims. to Jnls. If a tick is placed in the field, dimension values are not written into the journals and instead only assigned to the entries via the dimension matrix on posting. Block Dims. on Contr. to Order When creating the order from the contract, the automatic dimension transfer is blocked in all current order lines. The line dimensions of the contract are however transferred into the line dimension of the order. Block Doc. Dims. on Status When there is a change of status of the order, the automatic dimension transfer is blocked in all current order lines. In this field it is possible to consign the corresponding status e.g. final control. Block Doc. Dims. on Release When the order is cleared, the automatic dimension transfer is blocked in all current order lines. Block Dims on Combine Invoice When creating the combine invoice, the automatic dimension transfer is blocked in all current invoice lines. The existing dimensions of the order line are however transferred into the invoice line. Block Dims. on Rental Invoice When creating the rental invoice, the automatic dimension transfer is blocked in all current lines of the invoice which develops or the completed order which develops. The logics for establishment of dimensions in the course of the rental invoice itself do however take effect before. Block Doc. Dims. on Posting When creating the posted invoice document, the automatic dimension transfer is blocked in all current lines of the document which develops and is posted. Of course the dimensions of posted documents can no longer be changed in any case. This option is however important in another context: If new unposted invoice documents are created from the directly called functions Quantity Correction or copy invoice from the unposted document, in them the field Block transfer of dimensions is automatically set to \"YES\" if it is also on \"YES\" for the posted document. This means that it is possible to avoid changes to dimension values in cancellations through validation of fields. Register Entries On the register entries it is possible to meet the following settings: Check Transport Entries, Check Personnel Entries, Check Equipment Entries Via the three fields enwis can be prompted to check applied entries for completeness. The following options are available: Never No check takes place. Entries which do not have an entry in the field No. or Quantity are simply ignored and not posted. With this setting of the system it is quite possible that incomplete entries may pass unnoticed and be lost as they are not posted. Purchase Entries are only checked for completeness in the customer area. This means that it is only meaningful if transport services are in principle purchased but not sold for example. Sales This option works analogous to only customer entries being checked for completeness. Always Both customer and vendor entries are checked for completeness. Waste Qty. Relationship, Transport Qty. Relationship, Equipment Qyt. Relationship, Personnal Qty. Relationship The corresponding service type determines whether the operational quantity fills the invoice quantity or vice-versa. Op. Qyt. sets Inv. Qty.: enwis interprets entries in the field Operational Qty. as quantity indications via e.g. a waste movement and thus transfers an input in Operational Qty. into the field Qty. to Dispose . For the option \"Op. Qyt. sets Inv. Qty\" this operational quantity is transferred into the invoice relevant field Quantity of the document line. Inv. Qty. sets Op. Qty.: The invoice relevant value from the field Quantity is transferred into the field Qty. to Dispose . <!-- --> Fetches Entries The field Fetches Entries controls whether entries which have been acquired can be posted or not. Acquired entries are entries which were just acquired in the daily reports for processing. While an entry is marked as \"fetch\" it cannot be processed or deleted in the order. When attempting processing the user receives an error message. Entries which are blocked by a daily report can also not be posted without further input. The option field Fetches Entries is the decisive factor for the programme behaviour. This provides three options: Do not post Acquired entries cannot be posted. When posting, the same error message is issued as for the attempt to delete or modify an acquired entry. Post The entry is posted with its original value although it is just blocked by a daily report; at the same time the corresponding daily report line is deleted. The daily report logic is hereby completely overridden if the daily report was not written back at the correct time. This option can only be chosen if work with the daily reports is not to take place in the way described. Update The entry is updated with the value input in the daily report and posted; the daily report line is subsequently deleted. In this way it is not yet ensured that the processing has already taken place as there is no possibility of checking the point in time of posting in the daily reports for this option from the perspective of the user. If the follow-up entry is to occur systematically via the daily reports through different users and possibly at various places, the option \"Do not post\" is to be selected as it is only then that a clearance by the user in the daily reports has to occur prior to posting. Personnel Entries by Vehicle / Transfer Crew thru Status Crews can be absorbed into personnel entries for the vehicle as an option. Auto-Create Entries The field refers to the point in time of generation of entries. It has the following options: Never Transport, personnel and equipment entries are not applied automatically and they can only be generated manually. On Operative Qty. The entry is applied if a value is entered in one of the fields Qty. to Drive, Qty. to Work or Qty. to Handle*.* The combination from logging of a defined service type (i.e. a service of the type \"Transport\", \"Personell\" or \"Equipment\" and an entry in the field Operational Qty of the Order Line has the same effect. Always | The entry is applied when it is clear which service type is logged in the order line. This means that a transport entry is also applied for example if no operational quantity is logged but a service of the type \"Transport\" is logged in the order line. This makes sense primarily if the entries are to be used for follow-up quantity entry in the daily reports. Then applied entries can automatically be fetched into the daily report in the order logging. The quantity data are added there and the quantities logged are written back into the entries. Create Waste Entries The field determines the point in time at which the waste management entries are to be applied. The following options can be selected: Per Function only | Waste management entries are not applied automatically and instead they must be generated manually via the function Create Waste Entries ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On Print | The waste management entry is applied if the required accompanying documents are printed out. All data necessary for this purpose can be recorded on the order line and the printing can also be initiated from the order form. enwis then generates the waste management entry suitable for the data in the background. On Lookup | The waste management entry is applied if the user changes from the line into the entry. Then all data relevant for the waste management entry on the line are transferred into this. On Lookup and Print | This option really should be: On Lookup and Print as the entry is generated automatically if accompanying documents are printed or the entry window is opened. Earliest | The entry is applied as soon as waste material, warehouse movement and quantity were logged, i.e. as soon as all storage relevant data are together. Latest Entry Posting It is recommended to set the value to \"On Releaste\". Then all entries allocated to an order are posted automatically within the framework of clearance of the order. In this way it is guaranteed that material and equipment movements are logged promptly and can be dispatched accordingly. Delete Posted Entries The field Geb. Positionen löschen controls whether the entry line or the documents which led to the development of the posted entries/the ledger entry may be deleted or not. As a rule it makes sense to prevent the deletion of documents if entries which have already been posted are present for them. The field has the following options: Never A document on which there is a posted entry can in principle not be deleted. We recommend setting this as the standard option so it remains clear which documents and processes have led to the development of individual ledger entries. Always The deletion of the document is possible without further ado; the posted entry, meaning the ledger entry does however remain which would make little sense as a rule as it is then no longer clear which process the entry emerged from. Optional Individual entry lines can be deleted if a tick was placed in the entry in the field Allow Delete after Posting prior to entry. No Del. Transp. Entr. v. Line The field decides whether the transport entry is fully deleted or whether just the vehicle is removed if the vehicle is deleted in the order line. Release Equip. Entry on Corr. Equipment ledger entries can be cancelled from the order. For this purpose the field Release Equip. entry on Corr.. must be ticked. If this is the case an equipment entry which may be linked to the ledger entry is cleared automatically, thus set to the status \"not posted\" on cancellation of equipment ledger entries from the equipment journal. If the equipment posting is cancelled, the equipment entry once again receives the status \"not posted\" and is subsequently posted on clearance of the order or posting of the entry a second time. This is however only the case if the field Release Equip. Entry on Corr** .** is ticked. If that is not the case the equipment entry is not cleared for posting again following cancellation of the associated equipment ledger entry in the order. The system behaviour for equipment cancellation from the journal is similar. If an equipment posting is cancelled in the order, it is relatively clear that the associated equipment entry should be set to the status \"not posted\" automatically. This does however also occur if an equipment ledger entry from a journal is cancelled. It is possible that a user may cancel an equipment ledger entry manually in an equipment journal. If this occurs, enwis investigates whether a further equipment entry exists for this equipment ledger entry in a current order. If this is the case, this is also cleared, as if it were cancelled directly from the order. Driver Personnel Group Code; Co-Driver Personnel Group Code These two codes can be used to define which personnel groups can be activated in the transport entries and in the dispatching via the corresponding fields as driver and co-driver. Unit of Measure Code Hour The field refers to the fields Driving Time, Loading Time and Laiding Time in the Personnel Entries and Transport entries . The enwis realtime function can not be used here and times logged must be entered manually instead. The time unit used here is specified via the field Unit of Measure Hour . Default Time Type Service; Default Time Type Equipment; Default Time Type Personnel; Default Time Type Transport The fields refer to the enwis realtime function. The standard time types are used if services, equipment, personnel and transport groups do not have any time types consigned. In the realtime calculation enwis calculates the real time difference from the daily data and times entered, thus the real service duration and requirement to the second. enwis must however be informed in which unit this conversion is to occur. This can occur specifically for each service, each equipment item and each transport or personnel group. Or this conversion unit can be consigned in a standardised way via the fields named. Transfer Dispatching Grp. from Dispatching groups are transferred from the vendor/customer task site into the order line. They present a grouping of addresses (e.g. city areas) Use Service Catalogs Service catalogs are compilations of various services such as e.g. certain combinations of equipment and waste materials. Service catalogs are set up under the menu point enwis Service/Service/Reports and Analysis/Charts & Views/Service catalogs and they can be allocated to individual sites, projects and customer task sites via a matrix. In the order line the link ACtions(Alt + F10) Line insert catalog line can be used to allocate a service catalog to the order line. The field Leistungskataloge nutzen must be ticked so that this function can be used. Check Service Catalog In addition to the selection of the services in the order, the service catalogs can also be used - as positive catalogs in a sense - to force or prevent the limitation to certain services or service combinations for a customer for example. The field Check Service Catalog is used for this purpose. This has the following options: Never No check takes place. If Catalog Code Exists A check only takes place if a catalog code could be established for the order line. Always A check always takes place. If the combination from service and allocated service relevant criteria is not found in the service catalog defined by the catalog code during checking, a clearance is only possible depending on the setting in the field On Catalog Comparsion Conflict . Save Man. Catalog Comparsion Any number of catalog comparisons can be carried out for each document at different times. The result window displayed only contains the result of the current comparison first of all. The catalog comparison ledger entries shown as the result of the current comparison are thus not saved in the database automatically and they first of all only serve for the purpose of information of the respective user. The temporary catalog comparison entries generated from a document by a specific matching can however also be saved. The extent to which the user can influence this is determined by the default setting of the field Save Man.Catalog Comparsion . The option values of this field are: Never The manually triggered catalog comparisons are never saved. Saving cannot be triggered by user either. Optional The comparisons are only saved if the user brings this about from the form displayed via the button Save . Always | The comparisons are always saved. Saving cannot be prevented by the user either. On Catalog Comparsion Conflict . The field refers to both the enwis system behaviour on automatic matching of order lines with service catalogs and also with so-called comparison catalogs or positive and negative catalogs. Such comparison catalogs can be allocated to all customer and vendor task sites and also storage locations. The field On Catalog Comparsion Conflict .on the other hand controls how enwis is to behave if a conflict is established between a relevant catalog and the associated order line. The field has the following options: Block Activity | With the option \"Block Activity \", orders which contain conflicts cannot be transferred to another status or cleared by the user while the conflict exists. If a conflict is established on change of status or clearance then this activity is not carried out and an error message is issued instead. The conflict must be resolved before the user can pass on or clear the order. --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Create Ledger Entries | With the option \"Create Ledger Entries\" comparison catalog ledger entries are formed automatically which save the established conflicts. The processing is however not stopped and the order can change the status or be cleared despite the conflict. This setting appears to make sense if comparison catalog conflicts are as a rule regarded as not being problematic and only have to be checked from time to time retrospectively via the compare catalog ledger entries or for increasing frequency. It is also conceivable that the operation is a bulk business which is not to be impeded by error messages which cannot be assessed or corrected at all by the case worker involved in terms of content. In this case the comparison catalog ledger entries could be checked regularly and promptly by a qualified employee in order to retrospectively process cleared orders with comparison catalog conflicts. Both | If the field is on the option \"Both\" then both comparison catalog ledger entries are generated and the activity saved. In principle this only involves a comfort function which makes the localisation of the conflict possible for the user without having to initiate an explicit manual match once again. He only has to call the comparison catalog ledger entry allocated automatically to the document from the document. Register Status On the register Status it is possible to meet the following settings: Status Change Functiom; Release Function; System Batch Post Function Via the three fields it is possible to consign individually programmed code units in addition to the standard code unit which are activated when these functions are called up. In this way special functions can be integrated in enwis which are not provided in standard and only make sense in certain customer specific contexts. Catalog Comparison on Status; Catalog Comparision on Release Both fields refer to the automatic match with comparison catalogs, thus the possibility of allocating negative and/or positive catalogs to customer and vendor task sites and storage locations and comparing them automatically with orders or order lines. The catalog comparison can be called manually by the user from the document; it can however also be undertaken automatically by the system via the options placed in both these fields on a change of status and/or clearance. Transfer Qty. on Status The field specifies whether and when an automatic service quantity transfer is to be performed. The quantity transfer involves the transfer of values in the field Quantity of an order line into other lines of the same order. In the field Transfer Qty. on Status it is possible to specify whether and for which change of status an automatic quantity transfer is to take place. Service Qty. on Release The field also specifies whether and when an automatic service quantity transfer is to be performed. The quantity transfer involves the transfer of values in the field Quantity of an order line into other lines of the same order. If a tick is placed in the field Service Qty. on Release , a quantity transfer takes place within the framework of the clearance (depending on the default setting in the field Transfer Qty. on Status for the first time or additionally). As quantities are however only transferred in lines which have empty quantities, quantities being transferred in duplicate is not possible. Assign text automatically If the field is ticked, free texts are allocated to the service line above without reference to a customer or a service within the framework of the clearance. In principle the allocation is important so that it also remains within the framework of the combine invoice. enwis works on a line basis in principle. It cannot therefore do anything with free floating texts which are logged in order lines. If these text lines are also to reach the customer within the framework of invoicing, they must therefore be allocated to a billable service line. Undertaking the allocations within the order form via the functions Assign text befort and assign text after controlled by the user makes more sense that an automatic allocation. This manual allocation occurs regardless of the setting in the field Assign text automatically. Via the field Assign text automatically it is possible to specify whether an automatic allocation of all texts which have not so far been allocated is to be made. Allow Partial Invoicing If this field is ticked then the clearance of an order can be retracted although lines of the order were already invoiced. Order Assignment on Release Allocation methods can be used to allocate other lines in which e.g. services linked in terms of content and supplements/deductions or similar are logged to individual order lines. The order line allocation can be initiated manually by function from the order or it can occur automatically. If a tick is placed in the field Order Assignment on Release , enwis automatically performs the allocation of the order lines in accordance with the consigned allocation method within the framework of the clearance. Order Assignment on Status The field has the options: , \"Dispatching\", \"Processing\" and \"Completion\". Here it is specified whether an automatic order line allocation should take place at all and at which status change. Automatic Order Assignment The settings in the two aforementioned fields only apply if the field Automatic Order Assignment was set to the option \"Always\". The field has the options: Never An automatic order line allocation does not occur, even for the manual start of the function from the order. Manual The order allocation only occurs through explicit function call up from a form. Always The order lines allocation through calling up function and automatically on status change or clearance is possible. Order Assignment Method Via the field it is finally possible to specify how the programme behaves on an automatic order lines allocation if allocated order lines already exist. The options are: Only if without Assignment Only automatic order lines are generated if none exist for the order line. Internal Assgnmts. Existing allocations which refer to lines within the same order are deleted and created or newly created by the automatic order lines allocation. Complete Assgnmts. All existing allocation lines of the order are deleted and newly created. Bal. Acc. on Release All the necessary counter posting lines will be applied automatically on order clearance at the latest. Transfer Bal. Acc. on Status In addition one of the options can be selected in the field Transfer Bal. Acc. on Status in order to allow the counter posting lines to be applied through a status change before the clearance. The settings described so far are shown redundantly - counter posting lines can be created for both status change and also for clearance - in this way it is ensured that each required counter posting line is only applied once. Bal. Acc. Transfer In the field Bal. Acc. Transfer the option \"Create Bal. Ass. Lines\" can be selected. For this setting counter lines are only applied for order lines which were already applied with a counter posting number manually by the user. The use of the option \"Transfer Bal. Acc*.\"* by contrast sees counter lines applied for all order lines even if a counter posting number was only posted in the order on one occasion. The counter posting number is extracted from the first order line, the posting type of which is identical to the posting type of the order header. The transfer occurs in all original lines of the same posting type for which no counter posting number was consigned. Subsequently the counter lines are generated from all original lines. If by contrast the field Bal. Acc. Transfer has the option \"No Transfer\" set, an automatic generation of counter lines does not take place regardless of what was set in the fields located above. Counter lines can then only be generated from the document by function. Via the following fields under the rubric Cust. /Vend. Changeover it is possible to control the functionality of the customer-vendor jumping. For the use of this function, the register General of the waste management set up must in principle have the field Allow Cust./Vend. Changeover ticked. The standard setting for this function is to be made in the three fields in the register Status as follows: Auto-Changeover on Release Auto-Changeover on Status Suppress Changeover until Completion For this setting the jump occurs as late as possible. It does however occur on clearance of the order in each case. This setting makes sense to the extent that the order processing is to be adapted to the \"historic\" development of the prices by the jumping. Therefore a jump at the latest possible point in time of the order processing appears the most appropriate. In addition it occurs invisibly for the user in the background on clearance so that the user is not irritated by changes to the business flow which are apparently made randomly by the system - if a purchase suddenly turns into a sale and vice versa. If an earlier jump is nevertheless desired, the settings in the fields Auto-Changeover on Status and Suppress Changeover until must be made accordingly. Register Stock On the register Stock it is possible to meet the following settings: Location Mandatory / Bin Mandatory Via the two fields Location Mandatory and Bin Mandatory it is possible to control that each warehouse inflow can be posted with just the indication of a storage or warehouse location. If a tick is placed in one or both of these fields, enwis checks whether a storage or warehouse location was assigned to the warehouse inflow on posting. This check occurs on clearance of the order so that it is ensured that the inventory posting occurs on clearance with indication of storage location or warehouse. Insert Location Assignment Via the field Insert Location Assignment a special enwis function can be used which makes it possible to equate internally generated waste quantities with externally generated waste quantities in the waste management company itself for evaluation purposes. Internal waste quantities occur in relation to storage location as a rule; as a rule it is the storage location itself through which internally generated waste quantities are caused. Therefore it is possible to allocate an internal customer or vendor to the storage location. If the field Insert Location Assignment is also ticked, the internal customer/vendor which was allocated to a storage location is extracted from the location card and transferred to the journal for postings in the waste management journal. In this way this internal storage posting also occurs with the indication of a customer and this is written in the ledger entry. In this way it is possible for internal storage entries to be evaluated statistically jointly with the externally caused waste movements from the actual business activity via the quantities of customer/vendors. Area Code Mandatory In the field Area Code Mandatory the system can be set in such a way that no material movement can be carried out without the indication of a Federal State. It only makes sense to use this option if a special waste management company works in more than one Federal State and consequently has to verify the origin of the waste by Federal State. Outward Stock Movement The field Lagerabgangslogik refers to the automatic application of waste management ledger entries. An individual warehouse outflow method can be consigned to each storage location and each waste material. This can lead to conflicts between the warehouse outflow method of the storage location and that of the waste material. In the field Lagerabgangslogik it should therefore be specified whether the storage location or the waste material is decisive in the case of such conflicts. For the option \"Location before Material\" the warehouse outflow method of the storage location has priority over that of the waste material. With the option \"Material before Location\" the opposite applies. Outflow methods of the type \" \" are not taken into account. If the method \" \" was allocated to the storage location for example and the waste material has the method \"FIFO\" the latter is decisive even if the option \"Location before Material\" was selected in the waste management set up. Allow Refusal without Qty. If the field Allow Refusal without Qty. is ticked, refusal ledger entries can be generated without an indication of quantity. The purpose of the refusal function is to redirect materials which require particular monitoring in line with transport regulations, either back to the sender or to a different waste management plant and to record this redirection. In the case of a refusal the transport does in principle not go to the company's own warehouse, thus as a rule not over its own weighbridge. The exact quantity is thus unknown but it can frequently be estimated. Therefore it is a good idea to post refusal ledger entries without indications of quantity. Use Waste Entry Type Matrix The waste entry type matrix is activated via the field Use Waste Entry Type Matrix . The waste entry type matrix controls how certain types of business transactions have an effect on the inventory. Allow Qty. Allocation The field Allow Qty. Allocation is used to control whether the waste quantity logged in the movement form may be distributed over various waste management entries. Normally there is a 1:1 relationship between movement form and waste management entry. If the waste quantity logged in a waste management entry does however have to be distributed over several storage locations, the waste management entry must also be split correspondingly so that several entries then refer to a movement form. The quantity allocated to the movement form is thus distributed over several entries. This is only possible if the field is ticked. Unit Cost. Calc. Function Via the field Unit Cost Calc. Function a code unit for the calculation of unit costs can be consigned. A unit cost method (e.g. option \"Calc. Function\") can be consigned to each waste material. The option \"Calc. Function\" means: The unit cost is established by a user defined calculation function. An individual code unit like this one can be consigned to each waste material as a calculation function. In addition or as an alternative, a global code unit can be consigned for establishment of the service price in the waste management set upin the field Unit Cost. Calc. Function . If the service price method \"Calc. Function\" was selected in the waste material but no calculation function was defined, the function consigned in the waste management set up is operated instead. Match Stocking Posting w. Catalog If this field is ticked, an explicit comparison occurs with the allocated positive or negative catalogs. Consider Int./Ext. Relations In enwis it is possible to consign references between a waste material and several EWC numbers. This can occur from the waste material card or also from the EWC card. The extent to which the consigned references have an effect on the operational business is specified via the option field Consider Int./Ext. Relations in the waste management set up. The following options are available and form a hierarchy which becomes stricter: Never The references can be consigned in the master data. In the operational area (thus e.g. in the field EWC No. on the order line) the references are neither displayed via the Lookup function and nor are they controlled. The Lookup of the field EWC-No. branches out onto the whole EWC table. On Lookup The references consigned in the master data are not controlled on selection of an EWC no. in the operational document. On Lookup e.g. in the field EWC No. on the order line these references are displayed instead of the complete EWC table in case references are consigned for the current waste material. If no references are consigned for the current waste material, then the complete EWC table is displayed as Lookup. – This is the recommended setting for work with waste material EWC references. If Available | The references consigned in the master data are displayed on the order line on Lookup e.g. in the field EWC no.; in addition the references are controlled on input of an EWC number. This only applies when a reference is also consigned for the selected waste material. This means: If EWC references are consigned for a waste material then only these EWC numbers can be selected for the waste material - regardless of whether work is taking place via Lookup or direct key input; the selection is restricted to the consigned EWC references. If no EWC reference is consigned for the waste material then EWC numbers can be selected from the complete EWC table. Always | In principle only consigned waste material EWC references are taken into consideration for both Lookup and for the input. If no EWC reference is consigned for a waste material, no EWC number can be input for this waste material either. Note The described tests and Lookups apply for the operational area, i.e. for documents and weighbridge tickets but not for journals. In journals waste materials can in principle be combined with all EWC numbers. This is required in order to cancel any incorrect postings due to incorrect master data and repost them. Man. Waste Ledger Entry Appl. Via the field Man. Waste Ledger Entry Appl. it is specified according to which criteria enwis proposes waste management ledger entries for the manual application. The following options are available: Int. Waste dependent enwis proposes waste management ledger entries for application on the basis of the matching of the internal waste material. Ext. Waste dependent enwis proposes waste management ledger entries for application on the basis of the matching of the EWC number. Doubly dependent enwis proposes waste management ledger entries for application on the basis of the matching of the internal waste material and the EWC number. Independent There are no waste related criteria available to enwis with regard to the application of ledger entries. The user has a free choice between all waste management ledger entries stored in the system. If manual ledger entry application is primarily used, this appears a less suitable option as the selection of the \"correct\" ledger entry is then very troublesome. Autom. Waste Ledg. Entry Appl. Via the field Autom. Waste Ledg. Entry Appl . it is specified according to which criteria enwis applies waste ledger entries to one another with the automatic application. As the automatic application occurs without monitoring by a user, the criteria are necessarily stricter. The following options are available: Int. Waste dependent enwis undertakes the ledger entry application depending on the matching with regard to the internal waste material. Doubly dependent enwis undertakes the ledger entry application depending on the matching with regard to the internal waste material and the matching of the EWC number. Autom. Creation of Job. Nos. Via the field Autom. Creation of Job. Nos. the numbering of projects is controlled, if enwis is set in such a way, so that a project is allocated to the contract on generation of a contract from a quote. This function is activated if the field Create Job for Contract is ticked in the waste management set up on the register contract . If a contract is created from a quote, then a project related to this contract is generated in the background at the same time which is automatically allocated to the contract. A project is only newly applied if a project has not already been allocated to the quote header. In addition to the contract header, the project is allocated to all contract lines automatically where another project was not already allocated. This function provides the possibility of forming service prices individually for each contract. If a project is allocated to each contract there is the possibility of differentiating the service price table contract specifically. The following options are available: | This option must only be selected if no project is to be allocated to the contract, thus only if the field _Create Job for Contract_ is not ticked. -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Job. Nos. | enwis goes back to the same number series as for the \"normal\" projects in the numbering of the contract projects. Contract projects and other projects cannot be distinguished on the basis of their numbering. Document | The project gets the same number as the document or contract to which it is allocated. Prefix plus Document | In line with the previous option, the project gets the same number as the document, however the maximum two digit symbol code is put in front of this number which must be consigned in the field Job No. Prefix . Job No. Prefix A two digit symbol code can be consigned in this field which can be placed in front in the Autom. Projektnummernvergabe (option = Prefix plus Document). Supplement Carrier from Order If a tick is placed in this field, the carrier consigned in the order adds to the movement paper (movement/transfer ticket) with the carrier if this has not already been consigned in the waste transfer note. Register Prozesse On the register Processes it is possible to meet the following settings: Add. Process Cost Ch. of Accs. Process cost plans can be created manually. They can however also be filled automatically on posting order lines. In the waste management set up the field Add Process Cost Ch. of Accs** . * must be ticked for this purpose. Then all process costs logged in order lines are automatically written into the process plan which was specified in the field General Ch. Of Accs*.* Name.* Service Error Selection Start In this field it is possible to specify the sources from which the new service can be selected within the framework of the service error selection. Service Grp. Rentals The field is of decisive importance for the rental invoice. Services are defined as rental services via the code consigned in this field. Rental services are set up automatically by enwis in the course of the rental calculation and written into completed orders generated by the system itself. Only services to which a service group code was allocated in the field Service Grp. Rentals , are recognised as rental services by enwis and they can be used by the system for the calculation and billing of the rental duration. For the rental invoice in enwis it is thus not permissible to consign a code in the field Service Grp. Rental and once again allocate this code to a service via the field Service Group code on the service card . Register Contract On the register contract it is possible to meet the following settings: Cycle Preview Function; Cycle Preview Function Name In both of these fields it is possible to consign an individually programmed report which is used for the cycle preview instead of the standard report present in enwis. Sort Cycle Preview by Here it is possible to consign according to which criterion the cycle preview is to be sorted as standard. The following options are available: \" \", \"Contract\", \"Task Date\", \"Business Partner\"and \"Businsess Partner Site\". The setting made here has an immediate effect on the structure of the cycle preview and it cannot be overridden within the function create cyclic documents either. Cycle Equip. Jnl. Template, Cycle Equip. Jnl. Batch If journal lines are to be filled within the framework of the generation of cyclic documents, the corresponding journal in the fields Cycle Equip. Jnl. Template and Cycle Equip. Jnl. Batch must be consigned. Merge Cycle Orders by; Cycle Merging Active for The fields refer to the possibility of combining cyclically generated orders on the basis of the reference sizes \"Contract No., Business Partner or Business Partner Site\". The four options consigned only operate as default values for the fields of the same name Merge Cycle Orders by and Cycle Merging Active for which are available in the periodic activity create cyclic documents . The settings made in the waste management set up can occasionally be overridden on calling up of the function by the user. Check next cycle date If the field is ticked, a tick is placed into the field of the same name of the function create cyclic documents which can once again be removed by the user on a case by case basis. If the field is on \"Yes\", enwis checks the next cycle date and corrects it where necessary. Order Assignment from Contract If this field is ticked, the allocation of the order lines occurs on creation of the order from the contract. Contract to Order Function; Contr. to Order Function Name In the field Contract to Order Function it is possible to consign an individually programmed code unit which is started if an order is generated from a contract in addition to the standard routine. Via this field it is possible to integrate special functions into the enwis standard environment, which are only meaningful or necessary within certain work flows, without any problems. Posting Date of Contr. Orders Default settings for the field of the same name can be set in the contract header in this option field and they can be corrected there if necessary. The field does in principle define how the posting date of the contract affects the posting date of the order. The options are: \"Order Date\", \"Task Date\", \"Posting Date\" and \"Work Date\". The posting date of the order can thus either be placed on the posting date of the contract or on the order date or task date of the current order automatically. In this context it is pointed out that the current task or start date is decisive in the further processing for the posting of the entries and not the posting date of the order. The posting date of the order is only relevant for the invoicing if invoicing occurs directly from the order. Otherwise a new posting date is set in the course of the combine invoices. No Transfer of Unit Price If this field is ticked, the price is not transferred from the contract into the order. Contract to Order In the field Contract to Order selected options are written as a default value in the field Contract Qty. Relations in the Contract Header . The following options can be selected: Default The field Contract Qty. Relations is automatically set to the option on new application of a contract. This results in the contract being restricted in terms of quantity. Independent The field Contract Qty. Relations is automatically set to the option \"Independent\"on new application of a contract. The contract is thus not limited in terms of quantity. Multiple Weighing per Line Options selected in the field Multiple Weighing per Line are written into the field of the same name in the Contract header . The following options can be selected within the framework of the multiple weighing: On request Automatic Never If the option value \"On Request\" is selected, a confirmation message is displayed in case a new weighbridge ticket could be allocated to an already existing order line. If the option value is \"Automatic\", the allocation of further weighbridge tickets occurs without request. With the option value \"Never\" no multiple weighing is possible. Contract Task Date (Default) Via the field Contract Task Date (Default) it is specified whether and, if yes, enwis is to transfer a service date specified in the contract into orders generated from the contract. The field has the options: Create The task date is set to the actual work date of the system on order creation from the contract. Transfer A task date fixed in the contract is copied into the order. Create when Blank The current work date is written into the order if no task date was fixed in the contract. Blank No task date is issued for the order application from the contract. The user must do this manually. Current Price in Contracts Via the field Current Price in Contracts it is controlled whether two different prices can be displayed in contract lines. This makes sense for long-term contracts where the price does change as a rule. The price valid for the contract application is displayed in the field Preis , in the field Current Unit Price of the contract line the current price where appropriate depending on the default setting. If work is to take place with this function it makes sense that the field Contract Pricing by in the waste management set up on the register Prices is set to the option \"Actual Date\". The following options are available: The current price is not displayed in the contract. The field is not displayed. If the field is nevertheless displayed manually by the user, then the message \"No Display\" is issued instead of a value. Show The current price is displayed in the contract. The field can however not be edited. Write Indirectly The current price is displayed in the contract. The price can also be edited via this field at the same time. Following changing of the price in this field, the dialogue Edit price by Criteria is opened automatically by the application. The new price is already entered into the field Preis of this dialogue. Write Directly | The current price is displayed in the contract. The price can also be edited via this field at the same time. Following changing of the price in this field the price correction made is written back directly into the price list of the database without the dialogue Edit price by Criteria being opened beforehand. You are however strongly advised not to use this option as a price change occurs here without any control of the relevant criteria. Deactivate Price in Contract It is possible to use this field to predefine whether the normal price field in the contract is to be automatically blocked out or not. The blocking out of the field Unit Price in the contract primarily makes sense if the function Current Unit Price is being worked with. As the current price is the current relevant price, it is as a rule recommended to display the current price and block out the old one. Block Contracts w. Cust./Vend. It is urgently recommended that a tick is placed in the field Block Contracts w. Cust./Vend. Only then can it be guaranteed that no orders are generated from contracts for blocked customers. If a customer is blocked, neither orders nor contracts can be created for him directly. In spite of the blocking it is however possible to apply new orders for this customer via the customer task site plan from existing contract lines or directly from existing contracts. This can only be prevented if the field Block Contracts w. Cust./Vend. is set to \"Yes\"! Create Job for Contract This field is used to control whether a project is allocated to the contract simultaneously on generation of a contract from a quote which makes a contract specific set up of service prices possible. If this function is to be used, the numbering method for these contract projects must also be specified in the field Autom. Assignment Job. No.. Consider Sub. Contract on Marks If the function Make Order from complete contract is called up from a contract and no contract lines were marked, all contract lines are copied into the order generated from it. The lines of the order then correspond to the contract lines one to one. If contract lines were marked, the programme behaviour is by contrast dependent on the setting of the field Consider Sub. Contract on Marks . If the field Consider Sub. Contract on Marks not ticked, enwis only copies the marked lines into the order. If the field Consider Sub. Contract on Marks is ticked, enwis copies the marked lines and all unmarked lines which belong to the same subcontract as a marked line into the order. Transfer from Contract It is possible to use this field to define what is to be transferred from the contract line into the order line if this transfer occurs through the selection of a contract number from the order line. The field has the following options: Contract No. Only the contract number and the contract line number are transferred into the order. enwis checks whether a service number which may already have been issued, the posting type and the entry in the field Post-with No. in Contract-/Orderline match. Service No. In addition to contract number and contract line number, the service number is validated into the order line even if this differs from a service which may already have been entered. Service/Posting No. In addition to contract data and service number, posting type and posting with number are also validated into the order line even if the values differ from values which may already have been issued there. Supplement only In addition to the contract data, the service number, the posting type and posting with number are transferred into the order line in case the corresponding fields in the order line are empty. Otherwise the fields in the order line must match with those in the contract line. Transfer completely The complete contract line is transferred - analogous to the creation of an order from a contract. Filter Service No. in Contract This field is used to determine whether pre-filtering should occur for the automatic filter onto the contract lines which may be in the service number which is already present in the order line. Whether this is desired or not is a question of work flow. If the contract functions are mainly used to compile new orders from various contracts, this is definitely a practical default setting. Always Filter Order Header This field can be used to instruct enwis to filter onto the contract lines onto the data consigned in the order header when looking up empty order lines. As a rule a customer or vendor is entered into the order header on order application. If the field Always Filter Order Header is ticked, filtering always occurs via the number of this customer or supplier on Lookup from the order lines into the contract lines. Do not Filter Task Site The field Do not Filter Task Site can be used to specify whether a customer task site or office is to be taken into account or not in the last named filtering via the data present in the order header. If the field is ticked, a customer task site present in the order header is not taken into account."

    "keywords": "Charts of Internal Waste Accounts and Charts of External Waste Accounts General When applying internal waste materials and also for setting up EWC materials an account is set up automatically by enwis for each material type in which all quantity movements of the relevant material are entered. Ext. waste chart of accounts and waste chart of accounts are completely congruent in terms of structure and function and they are thus described jointly here. Any number of waste charts of accounts and ext. waste charts of accounts can be set up. An individual plan name must be allocated for each plan. The ext.waste chart of accounts and the waste chart of accounts provide a comprehensive overview of all aspects of the material movements captured in enwis. All entries, ledger entries and statistical functions which are also available from the EWC card or the waste material card can be called via the link Related Information Account . Set up There is the possibility of structuring the account plan via the field Account Type which can be processed for every material both directly from the account plan and also from the EWC card or the waste material card. The function is thus completely analogous to that of the account plan of the general ledger. The field Account Type has the following options: Posting Material movements can only be entered on chart of account lines of the account type Posting. All EWC numbers and waste materials, the quantity movements of which are to be tracked via the chart of accounts must obtain the account type Konto. Heading Chart of account lines of the account type \"Heading\" cannot be posted. They only serve as structural elements to outline the chart of accounts and they are in bold font. In order to set up headings in the chart of accounts, \"superfluous\" EWC numbers or waste materials must be defined and characterised as headings. Total Chart of account lines of the account type \"Total\" also cannot be posted. If work is to take place with this sum function, those EWC numbers or waste materials, the values of which are to be added in the sum line, must be assigned to each chart of accounts line of the account type \"Total\" via the field _Zusammenzählung_. Both the following functions provide an analogous yet somewhat more comfortable possibility for totalling. Begin-Total Those chart of accounts lines which are to be added together can be surrounded with lines of the options \"Begin-Total\" and \"End-Total\" which refer to one another. These options \"Begin-Total\" and \"End-Total\" are particularly meaningful if the complete chart of accounts is structured in such a way throughout and hierarchical sums, meaning sums from sums are to be formed where appropriate. For this purpose it is sufficient to isolate the chart of accounts lines which are to be added together with \"Begin Total and End Total”. Subsequently the function _Indent Chart of Account_ must be started. In this way the field _Totaling_ is filled automatically for one thing. This means enwis establishes automatically which accounts are to form a \"End-Total\" (amount to) and enters the relevant values into the field _otaling_. For another thing the accounts are inserted in the chart of accounts in line with their hierarchical classification which increases the readability of the chart of accounts. End-Total See explanations for the option value \"Begin-Total\" (amount from). Quantities and movements The following quantities and movements are distinguished in the enwis material charts of accounts: The field Stock Qty. filters all waste ledger entries which do not have the entry type \"Drop Shipment\". Entries of the \"Drop Shipment\" entry type do not make a record via their own warehouse and instead show transports which are processed by the company between third parties, as a rule customers and vendors. The field Stock Qty. only excludes these transports between third parties and is thus formed from the sum of all waste ledger entries of the respective material. It indicates the quantity of the respective material in the warehouse. The fields Stocking (Qty.) and Disposal (Qty) capture the most important externally effective material movements. Entries of the type \"Stocking\" designate a material inflow from outside, as a rule from a customer, from whom waste is typically accepted into the store. Conversely entries of the type \"Disposal\" (designate the externally effective transfer of waste from the warehouse to e.g. a disposal site or incinerator. Roughly speaking it can be said that the inventory results from the difference of storage and waste management. The fields Pos. Adjmt. (Qty.), Neg. Adjmt. (Qty), Pos. Adjmt. (Volume) and Neg. Adjmt. (Volume ) only designate internally effective quantity movements. Such quantity movements are not captured via orders but via Waste Journals or Waste Reclass. Journals . These changes in quantity can result from inventory differences or weather influences for example. Changes to the inventory are thus captured by the waste entry types \"Pos. Adjmt\" and \"Neg. Adjmt\" (outflow) which do not have any external effect and which instead serve the internal stock correction. The fields Transport Pos. Adjmt. (Qty.) and Transport Neg. Adjmt. (Qty.) are by contrast used to show material movements which do not affect the warehouse at all. Only so-called route businesses are used here in which the waste is supplied directly from the customer to the vendor without being stored on their own sites in the interim. The route types \"Pos. Adjmt\" and \"Neg. Adjmt.\" show both sides of the route business, thus the mainly customer collection of waste and the mainly vendor transfer to a disposal site or incinerator. The fields Refusal (Qty), Partial Refusal (Qty.), Redirection (Qyt.) and Partial Redirection (Qty.) refer to the various types of refusal ledger entries. Refusal ledger entries are to be generated if hazardous waste cannot be accepted into the warehouse for capacity reasons for example. This necessary refusal to accept materials must be recorded for legal reasons connected to waste disposal. In enwis the recording occurs in the form of refusal ledger entries."

Both the following of the total of five possible options apply for the control of an explicit application: Application | An application does in principle only occur explicitly. If a waste ledger entry is consigned in the field Applies-to Entry No. on posting this is applied.

If no applicable waste ledger entry is consigned, it is not possible to post. This logic can (and should as a rule) be given additional structure via the settings in the option field Application skipped on on the waste material card. Ausgleich aufgehoben bei (application suspended for) If the warehouse outflow method \"Application\" was selected, it is as a rule necessary to add to the entry logics by setting up the field Application skipped on . This is always necessary when the same waste material is posted both in and out and the waste to be posted out is not exclusively the result of a treatment but never via another path. If a waste material was both posted in and out and an application is always required, then the posting of the first batch to the warehouse would not be possible because the posting routine requires an application but no batch to be applied is available. Therefore the field Application skipped on provides the possibility of nullifying the compulsorily required indication of a batch to be applied through the warehouse outflow method \"Application\" in certain cases. The field can only be used if the warehouse outflow method \"Application\" has been selected and it is otherwise ignored by the application. The following three options are available: The explicit indication of an application is always required. Stocking / Pos. Adjmt. The explicit indication of an application is only compulsory for the waste entry types \"Disposal\" and \"Neg. Adjmt.\" . If in the waste entry types \"Stocking\" and \"Pos.

    "href": "documentation/Waste Material/ReferenceCatalogs.html",
    "title": "Reference Catalogs | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Reference Catalogs General Information enwis has a comprehensive, integrated reference catalog system that allows users to execute automated and semi-automated searches of order addresses, task sites, and locations to find the valid waste materials, external waste, and services. This system allows users to answer questions such as: Do we have permission to dispose of a certain waste material from a task site? Do we have permission to deliver material to a certain waste management plant or disposal site (order address)? Do we have permission to perform certain services for a customer? Do we have permission to source certain materials from a supplier? Do we have permission to store material at a certain location? Setting Up Positive and Negative Catalogs Each vendor's order address, each customer's task site, and each location can be saved in both a positive catalog and a negative catalog. Both catalogs can refer to services as well as waste materials and external waste numbers (though location catalogs only refer to physical materials, i.e. waste materials and numbers). In essence, each positive and negative catalog actually represents three separate lists: a catalog of waste materials a catalog of external waste numbers (according to the AVV) a catalog of services Users can update the two catalogs from the vendor task site card , the customer task site card , and the location card . Each catalog lists the valid (positive catalog) and invalid (negative catalog) content. In the vendor and customer task site cards, go to Associated Information Addresses Positive Catalog or Negative Catalog to set up the catalogs. Setting up these reference catalogs enables the system can automatically check , for example, whether the selected waste material is valid for the waste management plant, the task site, and/or the location. However, this check is only done if screening criteria have been saved. If not, the positive and negative catalog can still be used as an information system; however, the system cannot check automatically, though this is not always desirable anyway. The screening criteria can be defined individually for each customer or vender task site and each location, and for each type of content therein. This can be set up, for example, in the customer task site card under the Waste Management tab using the Waste Comparison Type , Ext. Waste Comparison Type , and Service Comparison Type fields. These three separate fields allow users to differentiate how the screening of waste materials, external waste, or services should be done, and it can be differently for each record. The following options are available for all three fields: No screening takes place, even if a positive and/or negative catalog has been saved. Positive Catalog Only the data in the positive catalog will be screened, even if a negative catalog has also been saved. Negative Catalog Only the data in the negative catalog will be screened, even if a positive catalog has also been saved. Both Catalogs The data in both the positive and the negative catalogs saved in the system will be screened. How these screenings look and what they can effect will be shown further below in more detail. The user has a broad range of options to influence this as well. Let us begin with a simple case in which the a screening of the order with the relevant reference catalogs produces a kind of error message or informational message. In this case, the system would screen whether a waste material or service is valid for a specific customer or vendor task site and produce an error message if that waste material or service is not found in the positive catalog of that customer or vendor task site. When screening the negative catalog, the opposite situation triggers an error message, i.e. if the selected waste material or service is found in the negative catalog. Users can define individually for each customer and vendor task site, each location, and each content type (waste material, external waste material, and service) whether the system should automatically screen the positive or negative catalog, depending, for example, on which method is less costly in terms of time or effort. If only a few services are defined for the customer, the positive catalog is more efficient, whereas the negative catalog is better if all but a few services are offered to that customer. Working with, or even screening, both a positive and a negative catalog for the same customer or vendor task site might seem impractical at first glance, but it can be very helpful in practice. It is quite possible that the positive catalog is not complete or is only updated cyclically, so that materials not on the list are in fact disposed or delivered there. In comparison, an entry in the negative catalog makes it clear that certain materials absolutely cannot be disposed of for this customer or that certain services may be performed for the supplier under no circumstance. Automatic screening between the movement information and the reference catalogs can be initiated for all relevant operating documents in the system. These include: Sales quotes Contracts Sales orders Route plans Routes All waste management service lines related to the document will be screened. Catalog comparisons for routes therefore consider information that can be assigned to many different sales orders. A comparison need not be restricted to the document users are currently working on; they can also be done for several documents at once. In general, there are three different kinds of catalog comparison and each has different default settings and different consequences in the program for users: Explicit comparisons are initiated manually from a document. Automatic comparisons are executed in the background when a status change or release is done. Inventory checks take place when posting. These three different kinds of catalog comparison are explained below. Explicit Comparisons from a Document Users can manually initiate the explicit comparison of input information with the reference document saved in the system directly from any sales quote, contract, or sales order, and for each route plan and each route. This comparison is launched in the order header by going to Actions Function compare catalogs A screen appears that filters the document lines in the current document to be compared. This filter can be modified by users so that multiple documents are screened at the same time. When users initiate the catalog comparison, the information in the document lines is compared to the master data saved in the positive and negative catalogs associated with the customer and vendor task sites and the locations according to the screening criteria specified there. The result of the comparison might bring up different conflicts between the transaction information and the reference catalogs. If there are no conflicts, users receive a message telling them so. If there are one or more conflicts, however, these will be shown in a catalog comparison ledger entry form with all of the conflicting information. In the course of comparing the catalog(s), the system creates catalog comparison entries for each case where the document settings are not the same as the positive and negative catalogs. These entries record exactly which waste material or which service from which document conflicts with the positive or negative catalog and why. Any number of catalog comparisons can be made for each document at different times. The results screen shown only ever contains the results of the current comparison. The catalog comparison entries shown as a result of the current comparison are not automatically saved in the database; rather, they serve first and foremost as information for the users. The temporary catalog comparison entries generated through an explicit comparison can be saved (in a different context, these would be postings). The scope of users' influence on this is determined by the default setting in the Save Man. Catalog Comparison field under the Entries tab in Waste Management Setup. The following options are available for this field: Never The catalog comparisons initiated manually will never be saved, neither by the system nor the users. Optional The comparisons can only be saved when users do this manually by clicking on the Save icon in the form. Always | The comparisons are always saved and users cannot prevent this. The Save icon is only active when the default setting in Waste Management Setup is set to \"Optional\" and the current context allows this to happen. All created and subsequently saved catalog comparison entries related to that catalog comparison are visible, filtered by the context and regardless of the type of card or document. The catalog comparison entries can be called up in the order header by going to Associated Information Sales Order Catalog Comparison Entries or pressing Ctrl + F7 . Users can also call up a catalog comparison that is not filtered to a specific document by going to enwis Services Waste Material History Catalog Comparison Entries . Automatic Comparisons upon Status Change and Release The functions shown above with respect to manual, explicit comparisons initiated from a document have the benefit that users can employ them flexibly when needed and can react to them just as flexibly. As a reaction to an conflict message, users can change their selection in the sales order or ignore the message based on their own experience and understanding of the situation. This might be considered a disadvantage, however, because the user is not forced to act. Users might also forget to execute the comparison. Users always have the option of an explicit, manually initiated comparison (assuming they have the relevant access rights). In addition, there is an option for the system administrator or other authorized personnel to set up automatic catalog comparisons in the background, which operational users are unable to affect. All that is required is to change the settings in a few fields accordingly. The automatic catalog comparison could take place when the status of a sales order changes and/or one is released. The settings for this are defined in the Catalog Comparison on Status and Catalog Comparison on Release fields under the Status tab in Waste Management Setup . In this case, the catalog comparison is executed the same way as described for explicit comparisons. However, the results screen does not appear when the process is completed. How the system should handle conflicts found during automatic comparison is defined in the On Catalog Comparison Conflict field under the Entries tab in Waste Management Setup . The following options are available for this field: Block Activities Create Entry Both If the automatic catalog comparison does not find any conflicts, users are unaware that a comparison even took place. The status of the sales order is changed or the sales order is released, as desired. Block Activities Option When the On Catalog Comparison Conflict field is set to \"Block Activities\", users may not change the status of, nor may they release, sales orders that contain conflicts until the conflicts are resolved. If a conflict is discovered upon status change or release, then this activity will not be executed and an error message will appear. This conflict must be resolved before users can change the status of the sales order or release it. Users proceed to the sales order and manually execute an explicit comparison to determine what the conflict is and then to resolve it. Until the conflict is resolved, users cannot change the status of this sales order nor can they release it. Create Entry Option When the On Catalog Comparison Conflict field is set to \"Create Entry\", the program behaves quite differently. In this case, automatic catalog conflict entries are created that record the conflicts found; however, the sales order processing is not interrupted and users can change its status or release it. This setting is practical when catalog comparison conflicts are normally not a problem and it is enough to periodically review the content of the catalog comparison entries after the fact and to ensure the entries are not becoming more frequent. It might also be the case that the operational business is a bulk business that should not be hindered by error messages that the executing employee may not even be in a position to evaluate or correct the content of. In this case, the catalog comparison entries could be reviewed regularly and promptly by a qualified specialist to process the content of released sales orders with catalog comparison conflicts. The catalog comparison entries can be called up by going to enwis Services Waste Material History Catalog Comparison Entries . Both Option When the On Catalog Comparison Conflict field is set to \"Both\", then catalog comparison entries will be created and the activities will be blocked. In principle, this is merely a convenience function that allows users to localize the conflict without having to initiate an explicit comparison manually. All users have to do is call up the catalog from the document that the system has automatically assigned to it. A special feature of the \"Both\" option is the add-on function that allows users to release a sales order in spite of existing conflicts in exceptional cases. Instead of resolving the existing conflict, users have the option of requesting permission from an administrator or authorized supervisor to release the sales order anyway. This option implements the logic described below. When each sales order is created, it is given the check status \"Check Required\". This does not mean that a check will or must be done in every case. Whether a check is done depends on the criteria described above and the setting in the catalog comparison. The check status makes it possible, however, to suppress the check required by this setting for an individual sales order. To do so, call up the eponymous function from the order header by going to Actions Functions Change Check Status . Access to this option can be granted through the assignment of permissions, so it is easy to limit such access to certain users. If the check status of a sales order is set to \"No Check\", the sales order can be released in spite of a conflict that would normally prevent this release. When users encounter a conflict that they cannot or do not want to resolve, they could have an administrator or supervisor with the appropriate authority decide whether the sales order may be released in spite of the existing conflict. The check status is automatically reverted to \"Check Required\" after release of the sales order. If the release of the sales order is reversed at a later point in time and the sales order is processed again, the check status might again have to be changed before the sales order can be released again. This prevents users from making sweeping changes to sales orders and then releasing them without review. This is the same reason why, when sales orders are copied, the check status of the copy is also set to \"Check Required\". Automatic Comparison of Cost Posting A third possibility for automatic catalog comparison is to check the cost postings. The Match Stock Posting w. Catalog field under the stock tab in Waste Management Setup sets whether stock postings should be compared with the positive and negative catalogs saved in the locations according to the criteria defined in the location card. The following options are available: Location Bin Both When the Match Stock Posting w. Catalog field is set to \"Location\", for example, this check will be executed for each individual stock post, i.e. including flushing and transfers that are posted through the ledger or through treatment orders. If a catalog comparison conflict is found, the posting is interrupted. This error message cannot be overridden. However, only posts representing incoming stock (posting types Receive/Ship, Recognition, Transfer) will be checked. The write-off of materials that are located in the wrong place should not be prevented. Automatic catalog comparison is also suppressed for reversal and drop shipment posts."

The maintenance of data and structures like the contracts need additional attention. This increases the time needed for consultancy and training but as well for the users during daily work. Only based on very accurate data maintenance the resulting stock values can be somehow reliable. Everyone should be aware about this limitation when making the decision to work with stock values. There is an ongoing debate if the kind of \"negative stock value\" which result from the fact that we sell the service of receiving/collecting the materials and from the need to deal with internal – own treatment plant – or external costs – for (external) disposal – should be managed as a stock value. From the perspective of legal requirements for finance these are often defined as accruals not as a negative stock value. But from a controlling perspective it makes a lot of sense to apply the same logic as for positive stock values: Buying a raw material just increases the stock value and won't create any profit. Production costs can be handled similar to the purchase costs as a surcharge increasing the stock value. By later on selling the material the stock value get reduced and the sales amount deducted by this cost of stock value increase make up the raw margin. If the raw material starts with a negative value due to the sales amount for the receiving process instead of the positive value in a \"usual\" purchase process doesn't make a real difference from the controlling perspective. If the process ends with a purchase it makes as well no difference for the basic methodology. NAV item management is supporting this approach with some limitations to be kept in mind: Negative Stock quantities are very common in the waste and recycling industry with its wet bulk materials and with its liquids. The stock quantity in NAV is simply the sum of all posted transactions. Weighing the inbound and outbound transactions is usually manageable. But differences in the mass balance due to \"drying\", internal movements without accurate \"weighing\" and reclassification of materials without accurate mass balances due to limited weighings are common. So frequent stock takings are necessary. But between those adjustments the all transactions might sum up to a negative value. As this exceeds the functional scope of the NAV value management this needs to be blocked. Together with delayed posting of inbound transactions but most of all for internal processes resulting in stock quantity adjustments for the materials this situations might occur frequently. In this case special precautions are necessary to handle this situations without slowing down the processes too much. Sales amounts get posted as negative costs as soon as the sales invoice get posted. The analogous purchase amounts get immediately posted as expected costs. This \"delay\" might be important for some business processes. Content This document provides a rough overview for the Stock value management in enwis: The necessary setups (see chapter 2) and The basic business processes being involved: Inbound / Outbound for Valuable goods (= recycling) (3.2) Non valuable goods (= \"waste\") (3.3) Separation (3.4) for Valuable goods (= recycling) (3.4.2-3.4.4) Non valuable goods (= \"waste\") (3.4.5-3.4.7) Surcharges and Deductions due to by-services in the inbound, outbound and separation process (3.5) The intention is to give somebody knowing the processes in the industry a basic guideline how to set up a (testing) scenario. This document is not intended to be a full blown manual for the mentioned topics. Setups General Setup For the stock value management the following special setups in the inventory setup are mandatory: The management of the propper unit costs is technically only guaranteed if you prevent a negative stock quantity. This setting is clearly mandatory for enwis working with item and their values. In the waste management industry it happens quite often that you get payed for collecting materials. The setting of \"Allow Negative Inbound Cost Amount\" allows the sales amount for an order line stocking material to be posted as (negative) costs for the item which leads to a negative stock value. It depends on legal requirements for finance in each country if this setting should be set. But posting this negative costs is the only technical way to calculate proper gross margins for the outbound item entries. Setup of materials The usual setup for an item used in enwis should look like this: The item No is mandatory of course. A description is useful The base unit should usually be tonnes (to or MG) Internal information To avoid rounding issues during separations the rounding precision should be set to a small enough value. At most something like kg as in this example: Setup for item charges A service gets defined as Item Charge with the following settings: The service needs to be marked as Item Charge. The Item Charge Assignment fields defines how the charge for this service gets added to the material lines in the order: Manually: The user has to put in the split manually. This usually makes no sense in the enwis process. Equally: The charge gets split by the quantity of the material lines. ( Buggy right now ) This will be the most appropriate setting in most enwis cases. Amount: The charge gets split by the amounts of the material lines. This can be a setting in some enwis cases. Process examples Example data These are the materials being setup for the following examples: D is a material which get payed to receive it. A valuable good like metal scrap. E is a typical waste where you get payed to collect it. Of course sometimes materials in the recycling industry are somewhere in between valuable and \"waste\" and depending on periods with moving market prices, quantities and purity of loads the material might be sometimes valuable and sometimes you need to pay for getting rid of it. The examples should just be seen as a starting point to understand the value management in enwis. F is used to demonstrate how the values get passed over via production. So does G H is a by-product of a production in the meaning that it's a waste material like E where we will need to pay to get rid of it later, whereas F and G are valuable materials like D. Pure Inbound and Outbound processes Purchase and sale of valuable material The first example is the simple case known from all the other industries where you buy (raw) material from a vendor to sell it to a customer later on. This happens in areas like metal and paper trading. The collection of small loads and/or pure quality of these kind of materials might lead into areas where you get payed for the collection, which is basically due to the logistical effort, outdating the value of the collected materials. In this case the sum of the order line amounts will positive – seen from the sales perspective -. In this case the material is from the enwis perspective now what is named a non-valuable material in this document. So check out chapter 3.3 for those processes. First Purchase of material The purchase process starts with a contract lines like this: The posting type is purchase. A sales line with a negative price would end with a similar result Via the debitorisch-kreditorische springen it ends up as a purchase line in which case the result is exactly the same. If it get's posted as a sales credit memo - which in most countries and situation is not allowed due to tax legislation – the result would be slightly different. The line needs a unit price. The Material Reference Type needs to be Item Our example Material for valuable goods. It need to be a stocking = Inbound load The order created from this contracts brings the following additional data: Quantity of material (usually in tonnes). The task date for the receiving of the load in our location which becomes the posting date for the stock entry. A Location would usually be used but was left empty to keep the example as simple as possible. The order gets posted either as a release of the order or as a pure posting of stock: This is the result in the item chart of accounts: The 3 tons are seen on stock and as a quantity of stocking processes. The item ledger entry resulting from the posting is: Quantity is 3 tons. In this case this would show the quantity measured in tons due to a unit conversion routine if the order would have used a unit like cubic meter. This quantity is of course fully remaining on stock And the expected Purchase amount is 30. It's still an \"expected\" value as the purchase invoice wasn't posted yet – actually it's not even created yet. The creation of the purchase invoice – via combine invoicing – is the next step in the process: In the invoice, due to a price change occurring in the meanwhile, the price might have changed: In this example, the contract price of 10 got now adjusted to 12 in the (unposted) invoice. Posting this invoice now results in this modified item ledger entry data: The invoiced quantity is now 3 instead of 0. The expected purchase amount is now 0 instead of 30, As the actual purchase amount is now the 36 due to the new pricing. But most of all the Cost Amount (actual) is now 36. The details can be seen in the value entries for this item ledger entry: A new value entry was created with the updating data: Document Type is purchase invoice with the invoice number as document number. The withdraw of the expected cost and the posting of the actual cost instead of this The new cost per unit The item ledger entry quantity was not touched but the valued quantity got touched. Sale of valuable Material The sales process starts with a contract line of posting type sales: Posting Type is Sales, The Post with No is another business partner then the one in the purchase line. The line has his own price which hopefully leaves room for a gross margin. But most of all the Waste Entry Type is disposal – or drop shipment with pos. adjustment as drop shipment type - for this process. The order created from this contract line takes the following additional data: The quantity of the material – usually tons – And the task date for this delivery or pick-up from our yard. Posting this order results in the following data in the item chart of account: The stock quantity is now decreased to 2 which is the sum of the two entries of +3 and -1: The newly created \"sales\" entry shows the relevant data: Order number as document no. The Quantity of -1 The sales amount of 15. But no cost amount at this stage of the process! In the G/L this is seen in the following way: The stock value is still shown as 36 for the initially stocked 3 tons with 12/ton. To adjust this is the job of the Adjust Cost – Item Entries feature in NAV: ... which adjusts the outbound item ledger entry: By showing the expected costs for the outbound load. Which can be seen in detail in the value entry which got newly created by this function: Now this sell needs to finalized by posting the invoice. The following invoice gets posted: ... which updates the item ledger once again: By moving the – in this case unchanged – numbers from the expected to the actual fields. The details are seen in the value entries in a newly created entry: with values to withdraw the values in the expected fields and moving them to the actual fields. But even more important these actual costs and revenues got no posted in the G/L: The stock value got now decreased to 24 for the remaining 2 tons of 12. The sales amount is now 15 which is the sales amount from this invoice. And the AR is 18.75 including the applicable VAT. Second purchase order To show the impact of several purchase orders with different purchase prices for the stock value the following order was created: With the same tonnage as the first order. But a different price 14 instead of 12 And being a Stocking like the first order. In this case we step directly into the purchase invoice including the background posting of the item: After posting this invoice the item ledger entries are: The newly created item ledger entry for the 2 nd order with a quantity of 3 and a purchase and cost amount of 42. But the cost amount for the first sales order remains untouched with a cost of 12. Adjust Cost – Item Entry functionality Once again the Adjust Cost –Item Entry functionality fixes this situation. After performing the function the outbound item ledger entry got adjusted: By correcting the cost amount to the average purchase price of 13 from the two loads of 3 tons each with their price of 12 and 14. The data are managed in a new value entry: Which updated the G/L as well: The remaining stock value = Inventory is now 65 which is the remaining tonnage of 5 times the average price of 13. Second Sales order A second sales order is using: The same tonnage as the first sales order. But a different sales price Posting this order updates the item chart of account: In this case the new item ledger entry is using the new average unit cost without Adjust Cost-Item Ledger as the average price of 13 is still applicable: Non valuable goods („Waste\") The following example is following the same material flow as the example in chapter 3.2 for the valuable materials. The only difference is that from the financial perspective the inbound of the materials is a sales and the outbound is a purchase for this case of \"non valuable materials\". Starting point for the example In the G/L area we start from an empty chart due to limiting the monitored period: Concerning the stock we start from the situation resulting from the first example but we focus on material \"E\" which wasn't used up to know: In the contract lines only those data get highlighted with specific data for this process whereas the other data are similar as in the first example: and 4. Service and description might differ. and 5. The posting type is just the opposite of those in the first example: The stocking of material is a sales and The disposal of material is a purchase and 6. whereas the waste entry type is the same as in the first example First sales order The first order created from the first contract line adds the following order specific data: The tonnage of 4. The task date which will be the posting date for the item ledger entry. After the posting of this order the results for the stock are: The stock was increased by 4. The stocking quantity should have been increased by 4 as well. That's a kind of bug which will get fixed. The newly created item ledger entry looks very similar to the one in the first example: The amount is seen in the expected sales amount instead of in the expected purchase amount in the first example. And the expected cost amount is now showing a negative sign which is perfect. The sales invoice gets now posted with a modified pricing which is the analogous process to the one applied in the first example for the valuable material: Price got increased from 6 to 7 per ton. After posting the item ledger entry got updated: Sales and Cost Amount are both now \"actual\" instead of \"expected\" and the amounts got adjusted due to the new price. A new value entry consists of the necessary data to make up the difference: As the Posting date of the invoice was out of scope for the filter for the chart of accounts, the turn-over is not displayed in this filtered G/L chart of account. But at least the stock value got posted correctly : Purchase order for disposal The next step is to create a purchase order for the disposal: With the tonnage of 2 And the disposal date Posting this order results in the following updated Item Chart of accounts: The Stock quantity got decreased correctly. The Stocking quantity is displaying the result from this purchase order which needs to be fixed similar to the result from the sales order. If we take a look at the item ledger entry: We see, that the cost amount is initially not being posted, just the expected purchase amount. This differs from the situation for the valuable goods which looked like this: The „Adjust Cost Item Entries\" functions results in a corrected version of the item ledger entry: Due to an additional value entry: Being marked as Adjustment With the corrected expected cost amounts. Posting the outbound order as a purchase invoice: ...results in a second item ledger entry: The Purchase amount is posted as expected but Cost Amount expected is not yet posted. The Adjust Cost-Item Ledger function fixes these values as this function is exactly made to fix outbound item ledger entries: In the additional value entreise the values from the intial posting got corrected. The resulting item ledger entry is now showing the expected values: The result for the G/L is showing the reduced stock value as the quantity on stock is now 2 tons of 7 each: The AP are showing the values from the purchase invoice. Throughput Processes Stock value in separations The separation is the other operational process for the materials which is describing the process in our own yard/warehouse. The third process is the relocation (see xx). A separation can be the enwis representation of the following \"real world\" processes: Materials that are distinguished for the inbound process may be for legal reasons – different EWC (European Waste Codes – or financial reasons get put together in one bin in our location. This happens in tanks and in many cases for bulky materials due to limited number of bins. It occurs if from the internal perspective of further treatment and purchase the materials are seen as so similar that this mixing has no impact on processes, quality control ... This approach might be named \"mixing locations\". Materials are sorted in different materials. Sometimes one of the resulting materials is the \"cleaned\" version of the input material. In this case for the sake of a proper stock value management it's necessary to either define the \"cleaned\" material as another item or use two different locations. Otherwise you would run into kind of endless recursive calculation processes. But there are as well cases where nothing happens \"physically\" but it's just a reclassification of the materials. However, for enwis this needs to be managed as a separation. The last real world process is the automated outbound separation in one of the 2 following scenarios where in distinction from process 1 and 2 no measurement/weighing is performed around the separation process: In a sorting plant you might only care about inbound and outbound to avoid the extra effort and the limitations/ambiguity for measuring the throughput. In this case an automated separation \"producing\" the sorted outbound materials from the input material during the posting of the outbound material allows at least to monitor the estimated remaining stock on site without knowing how far it's already separated. And it allows for some controlling of the realized sorting percentages with limited accuracy for periods. Some customers are mixing the outbound material from the materials on stock following a kind of recipe. In this case the posting of the outbound might trigger this production independent from the time this mixture takes place in the real world. Seperation of valuable materials Starting Data The example starts with the stock resulting from the first example with an available stock of 4 tons of material D and an empty stock for the output materials F and G which we'll generate in the following example: With the following item ledger entries for the material D which is the input for the seperation: And the inventory Value in the G/L: Seperation template and production BOM A seperation template needs to be setup. The separation template defines: The steps for a separation if for example the output of a first step is used as an input for a second step for this separation. The following examples only describe the simple case of 1 step seperations. Behind the steps the input materials being utilized get defined by assigning a Bill of Materials (BOM) The output fractions get defined. Costs / resource utilization get assigned indirectly by the \"Routing\". The special fields important for this example are: 1. At least one step line is necessary 2. D (see 7) gets split in two new materials - both valuable in this example -. First of them is F 3. ... with an (expected) percentage of 70% of the input quantity 4. The other is G 5. ... with 30% of the input quantity 6. Cost Allocation Type \"Equal\" is the most simple type - more advanced types will get inspected later - splitting the costs by mass percentage of the output. 7. The components = input material result from the BOM with the following important data: 1. Mandatory UOM 2. Input Material 8. The routing (see 3.4.1.3) is managing the resources and related costs for the production. Routing and Work Center The routing is managing the resources and their costs for the production. The route defines the utilization of work centers: In the work center data entity the costs get specified. In the following setups for the work center the costs were set to 0 to simplify the example: The costs of production are kept out of scope for the moment by putting them to zero. The flushing method is set to manual to allow a pure manual input of the production journal. The workcenter gets inherited to the routing: Seperation Order The separation order gets created from the separation template: Choosing a template Enter the quantity. And by triggering the \"Refreshing Seperation\" function the following data – important for this stock value tracking get populated: The materials – D, F and G – With their (expected) quantities The Unit Cost and the Cost Amount In the production journal the quantities can be edited which wasn't done in this example: As a result of posting the journal the separation order got updated: Quantities are now found as „Actual Consumption\" or as „Finished Quantity\". But most of all the Unit costs and the cost amounts for the output materials got calculated. Posting results The posting results are visible in the item chart of accounts in means of quantities: The item ledger entries show expected costs for the output – as the separation order is still not finished – and as actual cost amount for the consumed input: After finishing the separation order: and ... the outputs are now posted as actual cost amounts: But the stock value has not changed which is a crucial requirement for a proper stock value management: The production cost – which we setup as zero to simplify the example – could have been posted as increase of the stock value but except of this, the all over all stock value should never ever change when you just separate materials. This is technically a challenge, but as we could see it's proper managed in this feature together with basic NAV functionalities. New purchase resulting in revaluating the stock Similar to the simple buy and sell case (see 3.2) a new purchase of materials with another price then the current average unit cost for the input material will modify the average unit cost for the input material. Given this input was posted for a posting date prior to the separation this needs to adjust the cost amount for the separation and consequently the cost amounts for the output materials. After a purchase of additional 4 tons of D, the item chart of account looks like this: The new item ledger entry shows a purchase amount of 44 = 11 / to: After performing the \"Adjustment Cost Item Entries\" all Sales and Consumptions with a posting date later then the new purchase – being posted for 8/17/2017 – got adjusted with a new unit cost of 12.20 instead of the former 13 including the consumption entry for separation SO-000024: For the consumption from the separation above (see 3.4.2.3 and 3.4.2.4) a new adjusting value entry was created like this: And the other item ledger entries from the separation got adjusted as well to make sure, that the sum of Cost amounts for the separation order remains to be 0 as the stock value should never change due to a separation (see above): These are the value entries for one of the output entries as an example how this is managed in the system: The results in the G/L need a deeper look: The stock value has changed: Former 38 plus Purchase of 44 Should sum up to 82 instead of 83.60. But this is NOT a bug but a feature if we drill into the details. The reason is, that we need to take the \"Cost of Retail Sold\" in account. The G/L entries resulting from the separation, the new purchase and the later \"Adjustment Cost Item Entries\" are: The initial separation summing up to 0 purely in the stock account (2130). The purchase itself increasing the stock. ( The opposite accounts are excluded from this filter ) The \"Adjustment\" on the sales being posted in the past but with material, which needs to be adjusted. This is partly \"withdrawing\" the initial move from stock value (2130) to the cost of retail sold (7190) as the stock value \"consumed\" for those sales was lower than initially posted. The adjustment of the separation as expected summing up to 0 purely in the stock account (2130). Seperation with by-products In the laste example the valuable material got splitted in two new valuable products. But of course in the waste management industry you will quite often run into a case, where the valuable product, for the case with the non-valuable product see chapter 3.3.1.3, get sorted into some pure waste and a \"cleaned\" material with a higher value per ton. The starting point is the existing stock of 10 tons of the material I: With a cost of 25 per ton: Seperation Template and Order The separation template for this example is very similar with the one from chapter 3.3.1.1: The input gets defined in a production Bill of Materials which was shown in chapter 3.3.1.1.2. The first output material is the cleaned up material Which is expected to be 70% of the input quantity The Unit Cost Allocation Type of Percent together With the Unit Cost Allocation Percent makes sure that all the costs from the input decreased by the cost from the second line (see 6 to 9) The second output is a \"waste\" = non-valuable material Which an expected share of 30% of the tonnage of the input. The Unit Cost Allocation of \"Fixed\" together With the Unit Cost Allocation of minus 2 will result in a fixed cost per to for this material. The separation order: Simply applies the separation template as seen before. With the tonnage of the input being entered as well. Reapplying this input populates the lines with the yellow marked fields for the quantities and the expected costs for the output which got calculated correctly: The costs of the input are 1 to of 25 making it 25. The costs for the waste material H are 0.3 of -2 per to making it -0.6. The resulting valuable product needs to balance these costs and therefore ends with 25.60 as cost amount which is 36.57 due to the tonnage of 0.7. Posting the production order without any change of the data: And finalizing the separation order with a status change: Post the numbers as Actual Consumption and Finished Quantities. Results The resulting quantities are visible in the item chart of accounts as expected: The item ledger entries for the separation order are showing the expected numbers: Second production with other split of materials In a second production order the material splits into the same materials but with a quite different percentage: New order ...25 With quite less valuable product And a higher \"scrap\" percentage of 35% The result in this separation order shows the impact on quantities and costs: The posted values can be checked in the item chart of accounts: And the item ledger are showing the values as expected: The cost for the input is once again 25. But this time it get increased by the negative value of 0.70 for the waste material H. This results in a value of 25.70 for the valuable output and a much higher cost per to for the 0.65 tons of this product. Adjustment of separation results All these number should be updated when the costs for the input material gets adjusted due to newly posted purchases for posting dates up to the production date. The process starts with a second purchase of material which gets posted after the productions got posted but which is for a posting date prior to the production: The second load of the input material I costs 35 per to compared with the 25 per ton for the first load. The tonnage for both is 10. The Adjust Cost – Item Entries function gets called for all the materials involved: Which updates the item ledger entries from the above example (see chapter 3.3.1.2.3): The costs for the 2 consumptions got adjusted from 25 to 30 for both separation orders of 1 ton each. The fix costs for the waste material H don't get touched as they are fixed. As the result the costs for the valuable material F get updated from 25.60 to 30.60 and from 25.70 to 30.70. Seperation of waste with partly valuable output The same process and comparable value flows can be expected for waste materials being separated. In the following example the more complex process of a valuable and a non-valuable output gets presented. A typical daily business case is all kind of cherry picking like stripping of metal scrap from mixed waste to sell this scrap and leaving the rest of the waste for the usual treatment. Starting Data The waste material to be sorted is material K with a current stock quantity of 10 which should get sorted into F and H without any stock yet: The value of the K material can be seen in the item ledger entry: It's a minus 200 or -20/ton. Seperation template and order The production BOM is very similar to the example for the valuable material (see chapter 3.3.1.1.2 and 3.3.1.2.1): The separation template is as well basically the same as in the other examples: The step defines the input With the Routing and Work center and The input material defined in the production Bill of Materials The first output material is the valuable material F with an expected yield of 15% and 7. Taking a percentage of 100% of the negative value of the input decreased by the costs which are taken by line 2: <!-- --> The 2 nd output material is a waste material H With an expected yield of 85% And a fixed negative cost of 25/ton. The Separation order applying this template looks like this: The quantities get populated as expected But the costs for the input And for the output material are only based on the positive costs – as seen in 3.3.1.2 – and which isn't applicable in this example. A first production gets posted from the production journal with the defaulted split: The result for the separation order are purely the updated quantities which are now \"actual\" and \"finished\": Result After finalizing the separation order including the unit cost adjustment and posting: The quantities got updated in the item chart of accounts: And in the item ledger entries for the separation order: The quantities are fine, The cost amount for the input material is fine as well. But the cost amounts for the output materials are kind of odd: The negative cost amount for the waste material should be 0.85 tons * 25/ton = 21.25. But at the moment the separation functionality is limiting the cost to the value of the input of 20. Taking this -20 for H in account the cost amount of F makes perfectly sense. But it should be a positive 1.25 if the cost amount for F would have been -21.25. Second production with different split A second production order \"...26\" ends with a different split of F and H: The yield for the valuable good is now 30% Resulting in 70% for the \"waste\". The item chart of account is showing the correct quantities: The resulting item ledger entries in this case are showing the expected values: The consumption is a negative cost of 20 as for the first production order. But in this case the negative value for the limited quantity of waste material H won't take all this negative value Which leaves a remaining negative value of 2.50 for the \"valuable\" material F. So the gross margin selling the material F would be the sales amount PLUS this negative value of 2.50. Adjusting the costs When the costs for the inbound process leading to the stock for the input material get adjusted this should effect the output of the separation in the appropriate way. This is shown with the following extension of the example. A second load of the input material got posted leading to an increased tonnage on stock: The negative costs for the 2 nd load are 10/to instead of the initial 20/to.: As both loads had a quantity of 10 tons the new average cost is -15. The Adjust Cost – Item Entries function gets applied to all the relevant materials: Which updates the item ledger entries: The negative Costs for the consumptions got updated correctly to 15. But now the same effect as for the first production order got applied for both production orders: The expected negative costs for the waste material H got limited to the cost amount from the input material of 15 instead of sticking with the 17.50 for the 2 nd production order or the expected 21.25 for the first production order. The resulting cost amount for the Material F is 0. Mixing of goods Starting Data The following stock is available at the start of this example: 40 tons of the valuable material I and 18 tons of the waste material K. From the following item ledger entries: With an average cost of: 30 per ton for I 15 per ton for K Seperation Template The Seperation Template for a mixture consist of a production order like this: First Item to be mixed is I With an expected quantity of 60% Second Item to be mixed is K With an expected quantity of 40% The whole separation template looks like this: The first step Defines the Routing and in the back of the routing the work center being utilized and The Bill of Materials (see the Production Template above) to be used. The fraction defines the output material which is G in our example The quantity split which is 100% as we mix the 2 materials into one resulting output material And the most simple Unit Cost Allocation Type of Equal to simplify the example. Mixing order The order for the mixing is simply a separation order following the usual process for a separation: Defining the separation template to use and The quantity to be separated. This results in the following numbers: The materials and their expected quantities. The costs for the valuable material But the costs for the waste material don't get displayed. And the resulting Costs for the mixed materials are purely based on the costs for the valuable material. The productional journal: gets posted which updates the separation order: But this is purely the actual consumption and the finished quantity. The situation for the costs hasn't changed. The status of the separation order got changed to finished with the resulting cost adjustment batch. Results Looking at the results concerning quantities in the item chart or accounts: Shows the expected tonnages for all three involved items. The item ledger entries are showing the correct values for the cost amounts as well: 0.6 tons of I – with an average value of 30 – sum up to cost of 18. 0.4 tons of waste K – with an average value of -15 – sum up to a cost of – 6. The resulting 1 ton of the mixture G got posted with a cost of 12 which is still a valuable good. Second mixture producing \"Waste\" In a second production order the mixture results mostly (90%) from the waste material K with a minimum addition of the valuable item I: Item 100 kg plus Waste 900 kg The resulting separation order is: Displaying the right quantities and The right costs for the valuable item. But the costs for the waste material and the output are not displaying the right numbers. After all the postings the quantities can be checked in the item chart of account, showing the expected numbers: And in the item ledger entries showing the expected numbers as well: 0.1 tons of I – with an average value of 30 – sum up to cost of 3. 0.9 tons of waste K – with an average value of -15 – sum up to a cost of – 13.50. The resulting 1 ton of the mixture G got posted with a cost of -10.50 which is making this a non-valuable item / \"Waste\". The average value of the mixture G is updated correctly: The unit cost is 0.75 due to the cost amount of 1.50. This amount results from the 2 entries of: 12 for the first mixture and – 10.50 from the 2 nd mixture So in average G is a \"valuable\" material. Relocation of materials Starting Data The example for this process starts with material being created via separation to make sure that the full value path keeps consistent when relocation is involved. The example will relocate some of the material F which was one of the two sorting products from I (compare the process in chapter 3.3.1.1 for the initial process leading to this starting data.): The material F was produced in 2 separation orders: 0.65 tons with a cost amount of 30.70 and 0.7 tons with a cost amount of 30.60. Transfer Process The internal transfer is driven by a transfer order: With the location the material is stored right now. With the location the material should get transferred to. An In-Transit Location is necessary as the transfer gets posted in 2 steps (see below) which makes a lot of sense if the transfer isn't just a short distance transfer from one box to another box on the yard for example. The transfer needs a posting date of course. The material to be transferred need to be filed in. The tonnage to be transferred need to be entered. <!-- --> With all these data entered the posting can be triggered: The first step is the posting of the shipment from the source location to the in-transit location: The second posting is the receiving at the destination location: with the following prompt from the system: The quantities in the item chart haven't changed as the material is still on stock: But as soon as we limit the entries to those for one of the 2 involved locations, we can track the transfer as expected: and These are the item ledger entries for this process: You can see clearly the two steps with the different document Nos and you see the cost amount for the transferred material of 9.08 which is due to the following calculation: Which proofs that it got calculated correctly. The rounding difference is due to the fact, that this calculation was done in Excel with the rounded values from the item ledger entry page whereas NAV is internally working with a more digits. Adjust Cost – Item Entries The next step is to look at the impact of modified inbound costs for the value management. This starts with an additional inbound for the unsorted material I with a posting date prior to the separation leading to our relocated material F. We purchased a new load of material I: New load is 20 tons with a cost amount of 400 making it 20/ton. The two old loads have been 10 tons each: For 350 = 35/ton and For 250 = 25/ton Which makes up the cost amount of 30 for the 1 ton of consumption for the separations from the 2 old loads. The adjust Cost – Item Entries updates the costs due to the new load: Based on the two quantities of 20 tons with 20 and 30/ton, the new average cost for I is now 25 which is seen in the cost amount for the consumptions: And this updates results in the following updates: New average cost for I = 25/ton New costs for the two outputs for F: 25.70 and 25.60 (instead of 30.70 and 30.60). Which results in the Cost amount for the transferred 0.2 tons: Additional costs / revenues Beside the costs directly related to the stocking and disposal of costs (see chapter 3.2) and their flow through the internal processes (see chapter 3.3) we might want to manage additional costs and revenues as part of the \"value\" for the materials on stock. The decision which additional costs should get inherited / \"activated\" in the stock value is most of all a business decision and might need to take some legal issues like the \"Niederstwertprinzip\" in the German accounting standard in account. In this chapter we describe the technical aspects whereas these business decisions need a separate discussion with the customer. Surcharges for valuable good The first example describes the well know process from any non-waste producing industry where you: By the raw material. Add surcharges for services like logistics or toll. Sell it and look at C – B – A to be the \"gross margin\". A new material \"I\" was setup for this example to start from an \"empty\" stock: Contract setup In the contract the item charge service (see necessary setups for item charges in 2.3) is simply added as an additional line to the line for the stocking (compare chapter 3.2.1.1) within the same sub contract: In the material line the important settings for this feature are: Sub contract no. to attach this material line to the item charge line (see 5) Material reference has to be \"Item\". The Material Code needs to be populated. The Waste Entry Type needs to be Stocking or Drop Shipment with Drop Shipment Type \"negative adjustment\" And the important settings for the item charge line are: Same Sub Contract No as 1 to make sure both lines will be part of newly created orders. The service needs to be setup as an item charge service (see chapter 2.3). Now you might setup the split of the charge in the contract already: In the popup page you can manually enter the assignment or via the function \"Suggest Item Charge...\" apply the setting from the service card (see chapter 2.3): In our example – and with the defaulted option of \"Equally\" for the Item Charge Assignment – this is not required at all. Order An order was created from the contract and the tonnage of 2 was entered with the resulting purchase amount for the material of 50 and the item charge of 40: Posting of this order creates an item ledger entry with the expected purchase amount excluding (!) the item charge in this process status: The posting of the item charges is part of the later posting of the invoice for the item charge. So only the actual charges get posted later down the process line but no \"expected\" charges get posted upfront: Be aware that this might have some business implications: In this early stage you see these kind of \"misleading\" costs. So these data are not supposed to be used to make decisions if a disposal price will leave us with some necessary gross margin. This might be an issue for later optimization of the functionality. Posting the item Charge / Results In the unposted invoice resulting from this order: The item charge price gets modified. Modifying the amount as well. Posting this invoice results in posting the item charge now. The item ledger entry purchase and cost amount get increased by the posted item charge of 30: The details can be checked out in the value entries for this item ledger entry with a separate entry for the posted charge: Showing the item charge service no and description. With the Cost amount being posted to G/L as well and with the resulting Cost per unit. A little bid odd seems to be the item No which is the service no of the material line instead of the Item no. Assigning charges to several material lines In documents with several material lines, the charge needs to be splitted amongst those materials. This is managed by entering a proper Item Charge Assignment: Contract A line for a second material was added in the example contract: With the same crucial fields as in the first material line: Same subcontract no. Material Reference Type is Item With same or different material And with Waste Entry Type Stocking Order In the order the different materials get stocked with different quantities: With the Item charge Assignment functions you and the \"Suggest Item Charge Assignment\" function from this page you can assign the item charge: With the option \"Equally\" the charge get simply splitted in \"equal\" slices for each material line: With the option \"Amount\" the charge get simply splitted in slices weighted by amount: This basic split options got inherited from the standard NAV functionality and seem not to be sufficient for the typical enwis business cases where a split weighted by quantities seems to be more appropriate in most cases (see chapter 3.5.5.2). As the management of those splitted charge amounts is buggy at the current status of development, the results from posting don't get displayed and described here. Surcharges from the outbound process Starting Data The example starts with a material I being on stock: With a cost amount of 25/ton making it 250 for the 10 tons on stock: Outbound process The outbound process starts with the outbound contract: Subcontract B is the outbound contract for this example The charge item service is the handling fee Which we purchase from our subcontractor With a flat fee of 40. The material outbound line should use the same subcontract to end up in the same order as the surcharge service. This line is a sales line as this example deals with valuable material. The material is I and It's an outbound = disposal of the material The item charge gets assigned as seen before: The outbound order gets created from the template: The tonnage gets entered in the order line. Then the order get posted and the resulting invoices: The purchase invoice for the item charge: With its item charge assignment: And the sales invoice (no screen shot). Result The quantity on stock is now reduced to 5: And the outbound item ledger entry was created: With the quantity and With the cost amount reducing the remaining cost amount for the inbound which is reducing the stock value And an additional \"Cost Amount (Non-invtbl.)\" for the handling fee as these costs have no importance for the stock value. But the gross margin of this entry could be calculated correctly from the following numbers: Sales amount (200) Minus Cost Actual (125) Minus Cost non-invtbl (40) Makes 35 The value entries show the details similar to the item ledger entry: Surcharges for waste The same surcharges managed for valuable materials should be managable for waste in the meaning of materials with negative value. The simple inbound/outbound process for these materials got described in chapter 3.2.2 Contract The contract for waste consists of: A sales line for the service of collection with the customer which results in the negative value for the item on stock. And the costs for example for the subcontractor performing the transport which should decrease the negative stock value to some degree. From the business perspective this makes a lot of sense: The value of paper collected from small wheelie bins gets outdated by the collection costs and you might be able to charge the customer for this service. But when we take the costs for our subcontractor performing the collection for us in account, this will now outdate the sales amount. So as the sum from both lines we \"payed\" for stocking the material which makes sense as we are now able to send out full truck loads of this materials to a paper mill for a serious price. Depending on the \"basic\" material price the stock value can still be negative if we talk about household waste instead of paper. But as well in this case, we might have stocked the material in a bunker for an incinerator where its negative value has vanished for some degree compared with the material which still needs to be collected from the household. Orders In the following example, 2 orders get created: One order without a subcontractor being involved: The collected quantity is 2 tonnes. But the 2 nd line got deleted as no item charge applies. In the 2 nd order: The same tonnage of 2 gets entered. But the item charge of 40 service remains in the order. Posting the orders creates the item ledger entries with the same expected (negative) Costs for both of them: This is the same situation as for valuable goods (see 3.4.1.2): The item charge gets posted as soon as the purchase invoice for this service gets posted: Item Charge Posting The resulting invoice for the item charge line in our example looks like: The posting of this invoice results in the corrected item ledger entry for the 2 nd order: Purchase Amount is visible and The cost actual are now showing the item charge and the (negative) cost amount still as \"expected\" as the sales invoice hasn't been posted yet. The value entries are showing the details: After posting the sales invoices for the collections of the waste from both orders, the item ledgers got updated as expected: The Sales amount and the Cost amounts are no actual and not expected any more. And most of all the cost amount for the 2 nd order is now showing the summed amounts of the received collection fee and the item charge for the subcontractor. So this material has a negative cost of 10 and the material from the first order a negative cost of 50. Details can be found in the value entries of course: Surcharges and Adjust Cost – Item Entry The item charges are adjusting the Cost Amounts of the inbound item ledger entries. As the outbound item ledger entries take their value from the inbound entries – usually in an \"average\" approach in the waste and recycling industry – this should follow the same value flow already documented for values resulting from the direct costs of sale or purchase (compare chapters 3.2, 3.3.3 and 3.4). The example uses the following contract extending the contract from chapter 3.5.3.1. So it's a waste where we charge for the collection (= stocking) – first line - , pay a subcontractor let's say for the transport – second line – and finally get payed a minimal price from the customer receiving the material. This could be a typical \"paper business\": For the collection of paper in small bins you might get payed. But logistical costs occur. The full truck load being dumped at a recycling branch or as bales being sold to a paper mill are valuable goods. The crucial fields in the additional disposal line are: The separate Sub Contract. The posting type sales as we charge the recycling branch for the material. The paper mill as a second customer beside the one from where we pick-up the paper The Material Reference Type Item The Material Code itself And last not least the Waste Entry Type of Disposal (or Drop Shipment with positive Drop shipment Type) The output order looks like this: With a tonnage of 2 in this example. Posting this order creates the item ledger entry for this output with right now just the expected Sales Amount and no assigned Costs yet: Posting the sales invoice for the output makes the expected sales amount an actual amount: And the Adjust Cost – Item Entry should now apply the average costs from the input item ledger entries: For some reason this feature is buggy. A deeper analysis identified that the item charge posting wasn't adjusting the data for the item average cost calculation. Making them valuable goods Production costs Production costs are quite similar compared with surcharges for the inbound/outbound processes (3.4.1 to 3.4.5): They increase the applied costs for a material which might be seen as the current value of the material. They are a result of the main process which in this case is a separation (see 3.3). Actually the value management in NAV is using the same data structures, additional value entries to manage this. So the result should be mostly the same as for the surcharges. Screen shots and description missing up to now. Current limitations Buggy item charge assignment Ursprünglich wurde nur auf erster Zeile verteilt. Erst die Nutzung der Assignment auf dem Vertrag führte überhaupt zum Split?! Missing Quantity related split See chapter 3.4.2.2 Blocking equipment services Equipment services which are services: with a non empty service type and/or with a non empty Equipment No and/or with a non empty Equipment Type are blocked to be marked as Item Charges. As usually the logistic costs and revenues assigned to these services might be seen as part of the value of the material, this limitation seems to make no sense. Eliminating this limitation in a test database showed, that the functionality is working fine in this case. Posting drop shipment with wrong sign Contract setup for drop shipment The usual setup for a drop shipment contract in enwis for a valuable good looks like this: The line for the collection of the material from the source needs the following characteristic fields to be populated: Posting Type Purchase as it's a valuable material. Waste Entry Type needs to be Drop Shipment The Drop Schipment Type needs to be \"Negative Adjustment\" which means its decreased from the source stock. Most users get initially confused by this definition. But it's the how enwis works. And the line for the drop at the destination: Posting Type Sales as we sell the valuable material. Waste Entry Type Drop Shipment as in the collection line. But Drop Shipment Type is now \"Positive Adjustment\". The resulting order looks pretty much the same but now with the tonnage of 2 being entered: Posting results But the item ledgers being created got posted with the wrong sign for the quantities: The collection line – line 10000 – got posted as quantity -2 and The delivery line – line 25000 – for the final destination got posted with the positive quantity of 2. As a result, the value management gets totally corrupted. Correct posting for incorrect setup If the user sets the contract up in the opposite way: With drop Shipment Type \"Positive Adjustment\" for the collection and <!-- --> With drop Shipment Type \"Negative Adjustment\" for the drop With an order with a tonnage of 4: The item ledger entries are looking much more reasonable after posting the order: After posting the invoices as well the item ledger entries got updated in the expected way: The sales amount for the material drop is the sales amount from the drop line. The purchase amount for the collection is the sum of purchase amount and item charge. And most of all the Cost Amount shows the same value for both line – with opposite sign of course – which is the same as the purchase amount from the collection line. The details can be checked in the value entries for the collection line: And for the drop sales line: Item Charges not adjusting average costs Contract Simple example contract for a valuable good: We pay For receiving the material We sell the material By disposing it. In the second line an additional item charge increases the costs for the received goods. Two input orders One load gets received without an item charge but purely with the purchase costs of 50 for the 2 tonnes: A second input order pays 50 for the 2 tonnes but an additional item charge of 40: The remaining item ledger entries look like expected: Costs of 50 for the first order and Costs of 90 for the second order The value entries for the 2 nd order look fine as well: Average Cost Calculation But the Average Cost Calculation was not updated: Only the two entries with the original sales amount of 50 for 2 tonnes each are visible without any adjustment due to the item charge. The Adjust Cost – Item Entries: Limited to this item And triggered with OK Has no impact for the Average costing: 3 rd input order A third input order with an item charge but a different purchase price got created: And posted. But with limited impact on the average unit cost calculation: The Unit Cost on the item card wasn't updated due to the missing Adjust Cost Item Entries: And the details are not really sufficient: The new entry is showing the purchase price for the new order correctly. But actually it's missing the item charge as well. The old entries are kept untouched still missing the item charge for the 2 nd order. The Average unit costs got adjusted based on this wrong data kind of correctly. At least the item card got updated with this newly calculated wrong value: Remaining issues / cases The following features and cases haven't been documented in this document and need further testing. Parts of them ended in identifying serious bugs and so have been excluded from this documentation for the moment. Item Charges Item Charges for material lines of entry type drop shipment See chapter 3.5.5.4 Equipment services as item charges Mixt amounts of materials and item charges: Mehrere Zeilen aber nicht alle Materialzeilen: Verteilung der Zuschläge Mehrere Zuschläge und deren Verteilung Negative Zuschläge Negative Materialkosten und Zuschläge Positive Materialkosten und Abschläge Other issues"

    "keywords": "Waste material card General Internal waste materials form the basis for the acquisition of all material amounts, stock rotations and waste balances as shown at the start. Waste ledger entries are formed exclusively on the basis of internal waste materials. General register A numbering series must be allocated to the field Nr . in the waste management set up on the numbering register. The internally used designation of the waste material is entered in the field description*.* If this internal waste material is the copy of an EWC number and there is thus a 1:1 relationship between waste material and EWC code, the official denomination of the EWC number can be entered in the field O fficial Description . A basic unit can also be given for the waste material in the field B ase Unit of Measure . The basic unit which was deposited for a waste material is activated in the various material journals which are available in enwis. The field Account Type refers to the waste material chart of accounts. The quantity movements of the internal waste materials are gathered in the waste material chart of accounts. Headings and sums can be formed. If desired, \"superfluous\" waste materials must be set up which are not used operationally and which just structure the chart of accounts. The corresponding account types such as \"Heading\" or \"Total\" must be assigned to these structural elements of the chart of accounts. The waste materials which are to be used for headings, amounts from and to, can be set up in the form of waste material cards or directly in the chart of accounts. An account type must be assigned to them. The functionality here is identical to that for the set up of the general ledger chart of accounts. If work is to take place with amounts from and to, it is important to start the function for indentation of the chart of accounts following setting up of the relevant accounts. In this way the accounts are indented automatically in accordance with their hierarchical classification and the waste material accounts which are to be added in the sum accounts are designated automatically in the field Totaling. Sums are only formed if the relevant basic accounts are assigned to the sum accounts in this way. Direct entries can only occur for accounts of the \"Posting\" type; in sum accounts only the sums formed automatically by enwis appear. A waste material can be linked in a fixed way with an EWC number via the field EWC-Code . If this fixed wiring of internal waste material and EWC key is made, this results in the corresponding EWC number also being transferred automatically onto the order line on validation of the waste material. The waste material can be linked to a storage location. The field location code is used for this purpose. If a waste material is as a rule entered for a certain warehouse, it makes sense to allocate this storage location to the waste in a fixed way. Transfer to the order line is automatic on validation of the waste material. Here the storage location code which was consigned for an internal waste material is in principle overwritten by one which may have an EWC number. The storage location code of the EWC number always takes precedence over the waste material storage location code. The field hazardous material code can be used to assign the waste material to a hazardous material. Hazardous materials can be set up in the menu enwis Services/waste Material/Lists/Hazardous Material Type . Hazardous materials are administered hierarchically by enwis. The hazardous material assigned to a waste material is overwritten by the one which has the waste transfer note facsimile on the order line in the event of conflict. In each case there is the possibility of once again manually overwriting the defaults of the waste material or waste transfer note facsimile on the order line. The field Automatic Ext. Texts is only functional in certain contexts as texts which are consigned to a waste material can be printed out in reports but are not used anywhere else in enwis. While texts consigned in the field of the service card with the same name are transferred into order lines, such a function is not connected with the field Automatic Ext. Texts. of the waste material card. Each waste material can be classified via the option field Material Type . The following options are available: Waste material Potential Recyclable Alternating The value set is transferred into the waste ledger entries so that evaluations can be controlled. There are no additional functions connected with the field. Control of the rules by which the application of waste ledger entries is undertaken occurs via the option field Costing Method (warehouse outflow method). Warehouse outflow methods can and must be set up by waste material. The options of the field have the following meaning: FIFO The application of waste ledger entries is undertaken automatically by enwis in accordance with the rule \"first in, first out\". LIFO The application of waste ledger entries is undertaken automatically by enwis in accordance with the rule \"last in, first out\". Specific | An application does in principle only occur manually. If an application entry is assigned to a waste ledger entry in the field Applies-to Entry No. , this is applied. If the field Applies-to Entry No. is not filled, the entry takes place without applying ledger entries. An application thus only occurs if a waste ledger entry was explicitly selected for application. Application | When entering, a waste ledger entry must be consigned for the application. If no applicable waste ledger entry is consigned, it is not in principle possible to make an entry. This logic should as a rule be given additional structure via the settings in the option field Application skipped on. If the warehouse outflow method Application was selected, it is as a rule necessary to add to the entry logics by setting up the field Application skipped on . If an application is always required, then the entry of the first batch to the warehouse would not be possible because the entry routine requires an application but no batch to be applied is available. Therefore the field Application skipped on provides the possibility of nullifying the compulsorily required indication of a batch to be applied through the warehouse outflow method \"Application\". The field can only be used if the warehouse outflow method \"Application\" has been selected and it is otherwise ignored by enwis. The following options are available: The explicit indication of an application entry is always required. Stocking/Pos. Adjmt. The explicit indication of an application is only required for the waste entry types \"Disposal\" and \"Neg.Adjmt.\" If the field Applies-to Entry No. is not filled for the waste entry types \"Stocking\" and \"Pos. Adjmt.\" it is still possible to make an entry. Disposal/Neg. Adjmt. The explicit indication of an application is only required for the waste entry types \"Stocking\" and \"Pos. Adjmt\". If the field Applies-to Entry No. is not filled for the waste entry types \"Disposal\" and \"Neg. Adjmt\" it is still possible to make an entry. An additional logic is also implemented for transfer entries. If the field Appl. Mandatory on Transfer is ticked, transfers can only be entered on indication of a specific application. The field Exempted from WTN is a pure field of information. A tick placed here can only be noticed on the waste materials card. The information that a material which does not require a transfer note is not used by enwis at any other point. The permanently updated balance of all inflows and outflows of each waste material is displayed via the field Stock Qty. If the field Blocked is ticked, the waste material for the acquisition in quotes, contracts and orders is blocked. enwis refuses access to the waste material and also to services to which the waste material was consigned. Note This blocking does however only apply for direct activation of the waste material or the corresponding service from quotes, contracts or orders. If the waste material was already consigned in a contract, a retrospective blockage of the waste material does not take effect. In spite of blocking of the waste material, new orders can be generated and entered from contracts without any difficulty.** Posting register The register Posting contains a few MS Business Central standard fields which do however only have a limited function in enwis and also fields for the control of the generation of rental value entries: It is possible to consign service costs for waste materials or have them established by the system and to use these service costs as a basis for the inventory valuation via the fields Unit Cost, Unit Cost Calculation, Calculation Function and Without Adjustment. The \"waste material rental\" can be depicted automatically via the option field Storage Rental on . Technically speaking the generation of rental value entries of the storage type can be controlled. Rental value entries of the \"storage\" type serve to enable the calculation of rentals for the warehouse put away of waste or other materials. The generation of a relevant rental value entry can be brought about by the storage or waste management of waste. If this rental value entry is present in the system, a rental for it can be calculated via the periodic activity of the rental calculation. Rental value entries of the \"storage\" type are generated automatically if the field Story Rental on is set to an option other than \"blank\" on the waste material card. This field has the following options: Rental value entries are not generated automatically for this waste material. Stocking Rental value entries are generated automatically for entries with the waste management entry type \"Stocking\" with this waste material. Disposal Rental value entries are generated automatically for entries with the waste management entry type \"Disposal\" (waste management) with this waste material. (Both) Rental value entries are generated automatically for entries with the waste management entry type \"Stocking\" or \"Disposal\" with this waste material. Note The creation of rental value entries can not only be defined waste material specifically via the field Story Rental on , e.g. for the waste material \"documents\" in order to be able to calculate the document put-away but also specifically to storage locations. The same field with the same options is available on the Location card. It is for example possible to use this to control rental value entries of the storage type for all waste materials which are entered on the storage location Archiv. The fields Gen. Prod. Posting Group and Inventory Posting Group were absorbed into the MS Dynamics Standards article card during the development of enwis**.** They have no function within the content in enwis but they are still retrieved when making entries. Therefore it is necessary to consign posting groups in these fields. It is insignificant which posting groups are indicated as product posting groups or storage posting groups on the waste material card as postings on financial accounts are not connected with the entering of waste materials or more precisely with the entering of waste entries in any way. It is recommended that a \"Dummy\" product posting group or \"Dummy\" storage posting group is applied for the waste materials. The field Material Group Code can be used to assign the waste material to a billing method. This is necessary if rents for the put away or storage of waste e.g. documents are to be calculated via rental value entries of the storage type. The relevant billing method for the business transaction at hand is established in the rental invoice matrix via the combination of customer criteria and the material group code consigned for the waste material. The billing method calculates the rental duration, the rental service to be used as a basis and thus also the rental price for all open rental value entries. The field Without Adjustment is functionally linked to the field Cost (adjusted) in the waste ledger entries (it is not present in the waste ledger entries). If the field Without Adjustment is not ticked, a service cost input in the waste entry is transferred into the field Cost (adjusted) of the waste ledger entry when entering. If the field Without Adjustment is ticked, this (temporary) allocation of an inventory value to the waste ledger entry does not occur. In each case an already entered value in the field Cost (adjusted) through the periodic Adjust Cost-Waste Entries is newly calculated and corrected where necessary. Values of the dimensions cost object and cost center can be assigned to the waste material in a fixed way via the fields Cost Object and Cost center so that they are transferred into the order line automatically on validation of the waste material. Treatment Register Waste materials can be allocated to a treatment process in a fixed way via the register Treatement . Treatment processes are set up in the menu Treatment. The details of the definition of treatment processes are described in separate documentation which means that we will limit ourselves to the essentials here. Treatment orders are created from treatment processes just as orders are generated from contracts. If in the field Method No. (Pos. Adjmt.) a treatment process was assigned to a waste material in a fixed way, all warehouse inflows of this waste material are compelled to follow the treatment process. Treatment orders are in principle non billable internal orders, the main task of which is to document the \"material production\" by quantity through mixing and separation. Treatment processes are not just able to be consigned for waste materials where they are compulsory for the inflow of the material and treatment processes also apply for the outflow of a material. The outflow of the material does of course require that the basic materials for the treatment process are present in the warehouse. The outflow of the basic materials, the inflow of the complete product and the outflow of it are entered in one stage for the outflow of a material via a process. The fixed connection of a waste material with a treatment process via the fields Method No. (Pos. Adjmt.) and Method No. (Neg. Adjmt.) is in any case only meaningful if the movements of the relevant material are actually linked as a rule with the running through of this process as enwis undertakes the creation of the corresponding orders and all entries in the background fully automatically. The fields Method Grp. Code (Pos. Adjmt.) and Method Grp. Code (Neg. Adjmt.) only have an informative character in this context. Several treatment processes can be condensed into meaningful groups in terms of content via method groups. The creation of orders or entries are however not triggered by method groups. unit tracking register) It is possible to control the tracking of individual items or batches of a waste material via batch and serial numbers in the unit tracking register of the waste material card. This plays a role in the destruction of documents for example which are put into storage for a certain period of time and need to be destroyed once this period has passed. Both the putting into storage and punctual destruction can be documented by batch and serial numbers. The ear marking number to be documented can also be recorded via this function for the rendering service. The unit tracking is controlled via unit tracking codes in enwis. This code determines whether the part of a waste material can be entered with indication of batch number and/or serial number and how these numbers are generated. The batch number is thus the superordinate reference value - several serial numbers can thus be assigned to a batch. Conversely it is not possible to enter several waste entries with an identical serial number; each entered serial number is thus unique. Observation texts can be assigned to each batch number and each serial number which describe or explain the batch more closely. It is also possible here to specify that each batch number and/or each serial number must show a comment text via unit tracking codes so that it can be entered."

    "keywords": "Waste Material - EWC - Instructions for set up General External waste materials result from guidelines of the legislator; therefore the European Waste List is decisive in accordance with the Waste List Directive (AVV). Internal waste materials can be freely defined and can be placed in any relationship to EWC numbers. Internal waste materials can refer to several EWC numbers; conversely an EWC number can be assigned to any number of internal waste materials. A materials catalog can be defined via internal waste materials which depicts the business activity of the respective disposal and recycling operation. The set up of an internal materials catalog is absolutely necessary in enwis in order to be able to form waste ledger entries. Waste ledger entries are formed exclusively on the basis of internal waste materials. Even where there is a 1:1 relationship between EWC numbers and internal waste materials, the latter must be defined in order to be able to enter the former in the form of waste ledger entries. The reason for this is found in the practice of most waste management companies for which the internal freely defined waste materials catalog has considerably more relevance than the official EWC catalog. This means that the depiction of all material flows and the waste balances occurs on the basis of the internal waste materials or to put it more precisely on the basis of waste ledger entries which can only be formed by means of internal waste materials. The EWC catalog is made available to customers of tegos gmbh in the form of a text file which can easily be imported into the database. The EWC catalog corresponds to the version valid at the time. Subsequently the internal waste materials must be defined whereby relationships between internal waste materials and EWC numbers are set up. There is an N to N relationship between internal waste materials and EWC numbers via the so-called waste material EWC references. This means that each internal waste material can be linked to any number of EWC numbers and conversely any number of internal waste types can be allocated to each EWC number. Both types of linking can be displayed as follows in diagram form: The relationships between EWC codes and internal waste materials can also run \"crosswise\" so that several waste materials are each linked with several EWC numbers and the EWC numbers also with several waste materials. It is also possible to link each internal waste material with a single EWC number in a fixed manner; then the EWC number is also transferred automatically on validation of the waste material in the order line. If several EWC numbers are connected with a waste material, the user must make a manual selection from these on the order line. Internal waste materials can of course also be formed completely detached from every EWC reference. The internal waste materials are thus also a type of link between the invoice relevant services and the EWC numbers which serve exclusively for legal material classification. Waste materials cannot be sold directly; the waste material can thus not be compared with the article in MS Business Central. Instead a waste material is a compulsory component of a service in enwis. Waste materials can only be bought and sold in the form of services. This means that prices can only be assigned to services while this is not possible for waste materials. Waste materials are however a criterion for price formation unlike EWC numbers. This means that the service price can be differentiated depending on the waste material but not depending on the EWC number. It is recommended that the method of transfer of the internal waste material types to the operational area i.e. the order line is taken into consideration during the set up. The relationship of a billable service and the price forming waste material among other things must be designed here in particular. In practice the method of setting up an individual service for each internal waste material has been proven. The data flow can look as follows diagrammatically whereby the variants of the relationship of EWC number to internal waste material shown above are taken into account: During the recording of orders the service must be entered on the order line, this comes with the waste material and the waste material in turn is linked with several EWC numbers (variant 1) or just with one EWC number (variant 2). If only one EWC number was assigned to the waste material, this is transferred automatically onto the line; if several numbers were consigned to the waste material, the user must make a selection from these manually. The alternative to this process would be to set up just a single service \"waste management\" or to set up a manageable number of waste management services and to add to these waste management services with the relevant waste material on the order line. The advantage of this process is that the service catalog can be made very clear; the disadvantage however is that the user cannot avoid having to make a selection from a comprehensive catalog. Either from a differentiated service catalog (for the first process) or from a differentiated waste materials catalog (for the second process). The benefit of a differentiated service catalog is that many functions are only available on the service card and not however on the waste materials catalog. This means that it is for example possible to manage different warehouse and invoice units for services but not for waste materials. It is also only possible for services to consign texts which are automatically accepted into the order automatically or by function. Thus many waste material specific differentiations can only be depicted via services in enwis. In terms of evaluations it is also recommended to work with a differentiated service catalog. The service chart of accounts makes it possible to easily make statements concerning which turnover was attained with which waste materials if an individual service is defined for each waste material. An account is assigned to each service in the service chart of accounts on which the sales and purchase quantities and the associated proceeds and costs are listed. The more global the definitions of the services, the less differentiated the statements which can be made here. Analytical tools similar to the service chart of accounts are available in the field of waste materials in the form of the waste material chart of accounts and the EWC chart of accounts. These plans do however only provide information about the quantity movements and not about the turnovers which were generated with individual waste materials. Waste materials are the basis for the depiction of flows of quantities in the form of waste entries and waste ledger entries. When posting the waste entry, the same posting routines apply as for the entering of order lines in MS Business Central and in enwis. Therefore the general product and VAT posting groups are requested as standard here. This is superfluous where content is concerned as no movements on the accounts of the general ledger are linked with this posting of the material movements. Therefore it is not required from an accounting perspective however it is necessary for technical database reasons to assign those posting groups to the waste materials which only serve to link the operational actions with the general ledger."

    "title": "Delivery Status | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Delivery Status General Information The special requirements of waste laws and specimen collection regulations make it even more necessary to track waste quantities than ever before. Example: A waste material passes through the weighbridge in a truck. From this moment onward, it is on the premises of the waste management company and the quantity must be declared even if there is as yet no final determination, as this cannot be done until the empty truck can be weighed as well. If things are not running smoothly, several hours to a full work day might go by between the inbound weighing and the outbound weighing. The exact quantity of waste material on the premises must be declared immediately after weighing, even if it has not yet been posted to stock because it still has to be analyzed. This is required for the uninterrupted documentation of hazardous materials (those on the fire brigade's list) on the one hand and to be able to adhere to the specimen collection intervals set down by the authorities or contracted with the customer on the other, because there might be additional deliveries of the same waste material from the same customer before the first truck has left the premises. Posting the waste material to stock earlier is not the solution to this problem. For one, it creates excessive work to repost; for another, it cannot yet be posted to stock because the outbound weighing has not yet taken place and the exact stock quantity cannot be determined yet. Options In order to include waste materials already on the premises but not yet posted to stock in quantity balances, a delivery status (in the Status field) is now added to the waste entry . The following options are available for the Status field. Dispatched : The waste material has been dispatched but not yet delivered Weighed In : The waste material has already passed the weighbridge and is now on the premises, but the quantity has not yet been finalized and the waste materials are still in Dispatch Weighed Out: The truck has left the premises again and the exact waste material quantity has been determined but not yet posted to stock Posted: The waste material has already been posted to stock Inventory In principle, inventory is taken from two components: from the posted quantities in the waste ledger entry from the waste entries with the status \"Weighed In\" or \"Weighed Out\" When the quantities need to be differentiated, the waste entries with the status \"Weighed In\" and \"Weighed Out\" can be reported separately. The \"Dispatched\" status indicates waste materials that are in transport or for which there is a sales order, but that are not yet on the premises. Customers that have to or would like to use this logic must keep in mind that this requires more work, because the status of the waste material (dispatched, weighed in, weighed out) has to be kept up to date. However, the system supports users with a number of automated features. When a waste material goes over the weighbridge, the delivery status is automatically set by the weighing. As soon as the inbound weighing is complete, the status is set to \"Weighed In\" and when the weighing process is complete, the status is changed to \"Weighed Out\". This classification also works if the manual input option is used in the weighbridge ticket. Another two options are available in the sales order. The Status field can be set manually in the waste entries. The Delivery Status field in the sales order header can be set for all waste entries in the current sales order (newly entered waste entries use the settings in the Delivery Status field in the sales order header by default). Statistical analysis is only conducted on the Delivery Status field in the waste entries. The Posted option for a waste entry cannot be set manually or indirectly through the sales order header; rather, it is set automatically by enwis when posting the entry, i.e. when creating a ledger entry. Once this is done, the status of this waste entry can no longer be reset (neither in the entry itself for through the Delivery Status field in the sales order header). It can only be done by cancelling the waste ledger entry. This is why the Posted option is not available for the delivery status in the sales order header."

All contracts will then automatically have the default setting from waste management setup. Options The following multiple weighing options are available: On Request Automatic Never When the field is set to \"On Request\", an acknowledgement message will appear when a new weighbridge ticket could be assigned to an existing sales order line. When set to \"Automatic\", later weighbridge tickets are assigned automatically, without the need for confirmation. Multiple weighing is not an option when the field is set to \"Never\". Weighing When multiple weighing has been activated in the contract or in Waste Management Setup, the program behaves as usual when creating the first weighbridge ticket. Since there is not yet an order line for this task date and contract line, a new sales order is generate and the weighbridge ticket number is assigned to the order line. For each additional weighing, i.e. when a new weighbridge ticket can be assigned to an existing order line, the waste entry will be copied and then assigned to the new weighbridge ticket number. At the same time, the weighbridge ticket number will be removed from the order line, because there is now no longer one but rather multiple weighbridge tickets assigned to that order line. The weighbridge tickets are detailed in the individual waste entries of the order line. The Qty. to Dispose field in the order line will be added into the total weight of all waste entries in the lines."

    "title": "Waste Entry Type, Waste Entry Type Matrix | tegos Documentation",
    "keywords": "Waste Entry Types and Waste Entry Type Matrix General Information The type and manner of inventory transaction depends on the waste entry type the stock was posted with. The following entry types are available for sales orders and inventory-related ledger entries: Stocking Disposal Pos. Adjmt. Neg. Adjmt. Transfer Drop Shipment The waste entry types stocking and Pos. adjmt. are considered positive inventory transactions, i.e., the amount of inventory increases. The waste entry types Disposal and neg. adjmt. are considered negative inventory transactions, i.e., the amount of inventory decreases. The difference between these waste entry types, is that the positive transaction stocking and the negative transaction Disposal have an external impact, whereas the positive transaction Pos. adjmt. and the negative transaction neg. adjmt. are strictly for internal purposes. The waste entry type Drop Shipment is useful for tracking inventory-related transactions that are not processed in the company's own warehouses but rather go directly from one business partner to another. The waste entry types are explained in further detail below. Waste Entry Type: Stocking A Stocking transaction always represents a positive transaction of a quantity of goods from a business partner to the company's own inventory. In the waste management industry, this external business partner is normally a customer, because the sale of waste management services means that a material is picked up from a customer and transferred to the company's own inventory. In normal retail business, this is the other way around; the sale of merchandise normally decreases the retail company's own inventory. In the waste management industry, a Stocking transaction can also result from business with vendors. This is normally the case when dealing with recyclable materials, e.g. paper. Unlike in the general retail business, the type of business transaction (meaning posting types Sales or Purchasing ) in the waste management industry may be associated with inventory transactions moving in different directions (meaning the waste entry types Stocking and Disposal ); consequently, these are managed independently in enwis. In general, a positive quantity transaction should be posted in a sales order with the posting type stocking , since it is usually the result of an external relationship with a business partner. When posting a stocking waste entry in the ledger, make sure to also enter the corresponding business partner. In other words, the Posting Type , Post-with No. , and Task-at Code fields should be filled in the same way as though the inventory transaction were created in a sales order. Waste Entry Type: Pos. Adjmt. In contrast to the Stocking type, a Pos. adjmt. represents a positive quantity movement arising from a transaction with only internal influence. No external business partners are involved in such a quantity transaction. When an internal business case needs to be posted, this is done with the Pos. adjmt. waste entry type. The posting is normally done in the ledger. Do NOT fill out the Posting Type , Post-with No. , and Task-at Code fields in the ledger. Pos. adjmt. entry types are used to record things like inventory differences, weathering, handling processes, separation processes, etc. Waste Entry Type: Disposal A Disposal normally represents a negative inventory transaction whereby materials are transferred from the company's own inventory to a third-party waste management company. A negative quantity transaction should also be posted in a sales order with the posting type Disposal in general, because it is usually the result of an external relationship with a business partner. When posting a Disposal waste entry in the ledger, make sure to also enter the corresponding business partner. In other words, the Posting Type , Post-with No. , and Task-at Code fields should be filled in the same way as though the inventory transaction were created in a sales order. It is also true for disposals that the type of business transaction (meaning Posting Type Sales or Purchasing ) may be associated with inventory transactions moving in different directions (meaning the Waste Entry Type stocking and Disposal ). Particularly in the recyclables business, a negative inventory transaction can represent business with vendors. Waste Entry Type: Neg. Adjmt. A Derecognition merely represents a negative quantity transaction with only internal influence, that is to say that no external business partners are involved in the transaction. They are used to record things like inventory differences, weathering, handling procedures, separation processes, etc. When an internal business case needs to be posted, this is done with the neg. Adjmt. waste entry type. The posting is normally done in the ledger. Do NOT fill out the Posting Type , Post-with No. , and Task-at Code fields in the ledger. Waste Entry Type: TransferTransfer waste entries are only used to post transactions with internal influence when inventory is transferred between two of the company's own warehouses or storage areas; no external business partners are involved. The transfer ledger is available for these postings. Transfers always involve a negative inventory transaction at one warehouse and a positive inventory transaction at another. Therefore, transfers do not change inventory overall. Waste Entry Type: Drop Shipment The waste entry type Drop Shipment is useful for posting and tracking inventory-related transactions that are not processed in the company's own warehouses but rather go directly from one business partner to another. The classic example is picking up material from a customer and taking it directly to a third-party waste management company. Note that drop shipment transactions actually involve two separate transactions. Pick up the material from a customer (customer transaction) Drop off the material with a third-party waste management company (vendor transaction) Therefore, a Drop Shipment transaction usually has two lines in the sales order: a customer order line and a vendor order line. Both lines are posted with the Drop Shipment entry type. To capture the quantity statistic for both the customer and the vendor, both waste management quantities are required, though the two lines will add up to 0. This is why the Route Type field is added to postings involving Drop Shipment waste entries. The following route types are available: Neg. Adjmt. Pos. Adjmt. Drop shipment posts with the route type neg. Adjmt. trigger a positive quantity transaction, while those with the route type Pos. adjmt. trigger a negative one. In the Drop Shipment business, picking up material from a customer is posted with a Drop Shipment waste entry type and the neg. Adjmt. route type which generates a waste entry with a positive quantity. Dropping off the material with a vendor is posted with a Drop Shipment entry type and the Pos. adjmt. route type. This generates a waste entry with a negative quantity. The same applies if the Drop Shipment transaction is posted through a ledger. Two lines always have to be posted to depict both sides of the drop shipment transaction. Since drop shipments involve parties outside the company, the Posting Type , Post-with No. , and Task-at Code fields in the ledger should always be filled out. Waste Entry Type Matrix It is clear from the descriptions above that the right entry type must be selected for each business case to make sure the inventory transaction is correctly posted. To ease some of the burden on users and guarantee that posting is done as accurately as possible, enwis offers the option of a waste entry type matrix where the system can automatically find the correct waste entry type and copy it. As already mentioned, in the waste management industry, customer business usually involves positive inventory transactions (meaning the waste entry type stocking ) while vendor business normally relates to negative inventory transactions (the waste entry type Disposal) . There are exceptions, however. For example, vendor business involving recyclables requires a stocking waste entry. These exceptions can be saved in the waste entry type matrix. The entry type to be used can be defined in the waste entry type matrix based upon the following criteria: Site Code Weighbridge Code Waste Material No. Job No. Business Flow Posting Type Post-with No. Task-at Code Bal. Acc. Posting Type Bal. Acc. Post-with No. Bal. Acc. Task-at Code The system only refers to the waste entry type matrix when the Waste Entry Type Matrix box is checked under the stock register in Waste Management Setup. If the entry type in the waste entry type matrix is Drop Shipment but no route type has been defined on the waste entry type matrix line, the system looks to the Posting Type by default to determine the route type. Posting Type Sales Waste Entry Type stocking Posting Type Purchasing Waste Entry Type Disposal Note Users require authorization on Table 5030645 Waste Entry Type Matrix before they can edit waste management orders."

    "keywords": "Weighbridge Ticket Warnings General Information The weighbridge ticket system might issue a warning if an implausible weighing result is ascertained or entered manually. This warning can be in the form of a warning message or an error message. If an error message is issued, then the action that triggered it cannot be executed, i.e. the calculated weight will not be accepted by the system. The settings in the On Implausible Net Weight and On Changing Posted Weight fields under the General tab in Weighbridge Setup will define what enwis does in these cases. \"On Implausible Net Weight\" Options The following options are available: : The system will not the check the result in the Net Weight field of the weighbridge ticket. It will not issue a warning message or an error message. Show Message: The system will check the result in the Net Weight field of the weighbridge ticket. If it finds the weight to be implausible, it will issue a warning message that users must confirm. The weight can be accepted despite the warning message. Create Error: The system will check the result in the Net Weight field of the weighbridge ticket. If it finds the weight to be implausible, it will issue an error message. The weight cannot be entered as is. The weight will be found implausible if one of the two conditions applies: The Loading Type field is set to \"Discharge\" and the result in the Net Weight is a negative value. The Loading Type field is set to \"Charge\" and the result in the Net Weight is a positive value. The system does not check the result until the weighing is complete. \"On Changing Posted Weight\" Options A warning can also be issued if the result in the Net Weight field in the weighbridge ticket is changed and thereby automatically transferred to the sales order, although the associated waste entry has already been posted. The setting in the On Changing Posted Weight field under the General tab in Weighbridge Setup will define what enwis does in these cases. The following options are available: : The system will not the check the result in the Net Weight field of the weighbridge ticket. It will not issue a warning message or an error message. Show Message: The system will check the result in the Net Weight field of the weighbridge ticket. If users attempt to change the weight although it has already been posted, the system will issue a warning message that users must confirm. The weight can be accepted despite the warning message. Create Error: The system will check the result in the Net Weight field of the weighbridge ticket. If users attempt to change the weight although it has already been posted, the system will issue an error message. The weight cannot be entered as is. Some background regarding this function may be helpful. When a weight has already been posted, changing it in the weighbridge ticket will not automatically correct the ledger entry or repost it. The weight information in the associated sales order will be changed for the invoice, but the waste entry, which is relevant to stock posting and already posted, will not be modified. Therefore, if the weight should be changed in inventory, as well as in the weighbridge ticket and the invoice, then the already posted waste entry must be reversed and then reposted afterward with the correct weight. The warning message and the error message inform users of this fact. In general, however, the system and only check and copy the information from the weighbridge ticket as long as the sales order is still available. If the entire sales order has already been released or invoiced, then changes to the weight in the weighbridge ticket will no longer have any influence on it."

Enabling “Show Lat+Long on Factbox” will add the Lat and Long to the information available in the factbox where the what3words plugin is located. Similarly, “Show Map on Factbox” will add a map image to the information available in the factbox where the what3words plugin is located. Both of these options are optional and do not need to be selected to use the extension.
